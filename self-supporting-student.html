                                            The use of modules encourages independent study. One of the benefits of using modules for instruction is the acquisition of better self-study or learning skills among students. Students engage themselves in learning the concepts presented in the module. They develop a sense of responsibility in accomplishing the tasks provided in the module. With little or no assistance from others, the learners progress on their own. They are learning how to learn; they are empowered (Nardo, M.T.B, 2017). Other advantages of modular instruction include more choice and self-pacing for students; more variety and flexibility for teachers and staff; and increased adaptability of instructional materials.

                                            Can Someone Expand this one more paragraphStudents’ determination to learning focused on self-determinationtheory. Edward Deci and Richard Ryan propounded the selfdetermination theory in the middle of the 1980s. Self-determinationtheory identifies the motivational elements that trigger people’schoicesand recognises two forms of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsicmotivations (David, 2014; Neutrino, 2012). Intrinsic motivation refersto the internal motives that instigate people to actions, while extrinsicmotivation refers to task execution due to outward benefits. Self-determination in G11 students leads to organizing and planning for better educational goals. It also increases the problem-solving skills in students and causes positive things to happen in their academic life during online learning.Examples of activities used in self-determination instructional programs include reflecting on daydreams to help students decide what is important to them and teaching students how to set goals that are important to them and then, with the support of peers, family members and teachers, taking steps to achieve those goals.​</a>

                            7. The use of modules encourages independent study. One of the benefits of using modules for instruction is the acquisition of better self-study or learning skills among students. Students engage themselves in learning the concepts presented in the module. They develop a sense of responsibility in accomplishing the tasks provided in the module. With little or no assistance from others, the learners progress on their own. They are learning how to learn; they are empowered (Nardo, M.T.B, 2017). Other advantages of modular instruction include more choice and self-pacing for students; more variety and flexibility for teachers and staff; and increased adaptability of instructional materials.

For lack of a better term or out of ignorance, we run the risk of exaggerating someone's limitations and attributing them to every part of their life when we simply refer to<strong> PWDs </strong>as disabled. They may assume they can't go beyond their limitations because this generalizes to the point where they do. We refer to them as "people with disabilities" because that is exactly what they are—people who live with disabilities but who, like everyone else, can carry on living their lives and accomplish amazing things despite some limitations.</p><p></p><p>To reiterate, <strong>PWDs</strong> are not just people with physical disabilities; we might discover that people with sensory impairments require special communication techniques.

                            22. Can Someone Expand this one more paragraphStudents’ determination to learning focused on self-determinationtheory. Edward Deci and Richard Ryan propounded the selfdetermination theory in the middle of the 1980s. Self-determinationtheory identifies the motivational elements that trigger people’schoicesand recognises two forms of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsicmotivations (David, 2014; Neutrino, 2012). Intrinsic motivation refersto the internal motives that instigate people to actions, while extrinsicmotivation refers to task execution due to outward benefits. Self-determination in G11 students leads to organizing and planning for better educational goals. It also increases the problem-solving skills in students and causes positive things to happen in their academic life during online learning.Examples of activities used in self-determination instructional programs include reflecting on daydreams to help students decide what is important to them and teaching students how to set goals that are important to them and then, with the support of peers, family members and teachers, taking steps to achieve those goals.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-determination pushes a student to achieve based on intrinsic motivation rather than relying on external rewards. A self-determined student takes action based on an understanding of options and with specific goals in mind. Self-determination instruction is often used with students who have special needs and may improve success as an adult, according to the National Center on Secondary Education and Transition. Students need a supportive environment to develop self-determination skills.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
