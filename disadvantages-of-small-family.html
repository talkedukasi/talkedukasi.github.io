Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</a>

                            1. What are disadvantages of a small family​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Not having a sibling relationship means much more than not having a playmate.   </p><p></p><p></p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-small-family%e2%80%8b">
                            2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a small family?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Better life quality for children
</p><p>
</p><p>Kids of smaller families get more attention to higher quality from their parents, causing higher achievements. Kids with one or no siblings can perform better in edification, as parents hold a restricted amount of emotional and economic resources these happen to be diluted, meaning their quality diminishes as the number of kid increases.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Amplified economic success
</p><p>
</p><p>Children with fewer siblings are capable of attaining amplified economic success and communal positions. Furthermore, the decision to limit the size of a family can be understood as a strategic option to perk up the socioeconomic success of kids and grandkids in modern societies.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Better life quality for parents
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents are greatly benefitted by a small family. The expenditure, such as of supporting a kid from cradle to university, such as schoolbooks, uniforms, trips, provisions, university fees, etc., is greatly reduced. Moreover, fewer kids create a more controllable impact on family finances, thus relieving strain and emotional pressure levels.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Less pressure on family budgets
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents of a small family experience less pressure on family budgets, making them to make both ends meet easily, and to make them doing essential shopping without any difficulty by buying quality products.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Maximum level of happiness
</p><p>
</p><p>The levels of happiness are maximized when the number of kids is limited to two for each family. Those who turn into a parent at their young age, which is habitually related to having a bigger family, reported descending happiness trajectories, whereas happiness levels were maximized when parents were older and had previously acquired financial and educational resources.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Less strain for mothers
</p><p>
</p><p>Mothers with one or two children experience less strain when compared to those having two or more children. This allows mothers to pay more attention to the welfare of their children.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. A small family is an ecologically sustainable option  </p><p>
</p><p>The size of a family plays a vital role in preventing and highlighting climate change. Actually, it may be the solitary campaign for ecologically friendly lifestyles, which really counts. Considering further influences impacts of climate change, such as the loss of certain species, a small family makes even more ecological sense.
</p><p>
</p><p>8. Smaller families are inclined to have optimistic effects on the life of a woman.
</p><p>
</p><p>Women are usually responsible for child rearing activities. A smaller number of kids would offer women additional time to develop individually and professionally. Smaller families could boost the empowerment of women, together with men, assuming more responsibility. Moreover, women who bear their first kid at their 30s tend to have fewer kids are better off professionally and economically, as well as in terms of welfare.
</p><p>
</p><p>9. Condensed health risk
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents are much benefitted with a small family, which include abridged expenses on food, additional time to devote to leisure or work, increased caring attention per kid, and condensed health risk.
</p><p>
</p><p>10. Higher levels of education
</p><p>
</p><p>Young individuals are more probable to attain higher levels of education if their family is restricted to one or two kids. While socioeconomic factors are pertinent, family size has a considerable impact on the encouragement and attention children get at home.
</p><p>
</p><p>Disadvantages of a small family
</p><p>Everything in the world has its own pros and cons, and a small family is no exception. Although a small family offers notable benefits to the children, parents, and to the society, it has its own shortfalls, as well. Some of the disadvantages of having a small family include:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. It prevents a child from becoming a well-rounded individual.
</p><p>
</p><p>During the initial growing stage of a child, there will be not much trouble in developing a child. As the child grows, the odds of making the child a well-rounded individual are more in a large family. This is for the reason that every individual in a large family delivers something to it. Whether it is an interest, fervor, a unique character, or an immense talent Is possible if the child has more siblings and there is something added fun and thrilling at all times.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. It makes the child a selfish individual.
</p><p>
</p><p>The most apparent disadvantage of a small family can be realized when the child is starting to get selfish. Devoid of that sibling relationship, the only child in a small family cannot learn the way to share. Although the child can involve in all activities with tons of kids where he/she can study his/her social skills, it is not equal to the steady companionship that a sister or brother can give.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Sometimes, a small family makes parents overprotective and excessively attentive.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sometimes, a small family makes parents over caring and excessively attentive, by not allowing their sole child to play or explore. It tends to create problems if the child becomes unwilling to be without his/her parents, as well.
</p><p>

Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Advantages of a small family and big family. Firstly, small families can have more comfortable lives. With fewer people living under one roof, there is more space for everyone while big families teach sharing and teamwork, they smile a lot because there's always something silly going on in their house.</p><p>On the other hand, the disadvantages of having big family is that not as much 1-on-1 time with parents, less money, less space and someone is always fighting while small family's disadvantages is that parents are sometimes overprotective and overly attentive, not really letting their child explore or play at times.</p><br />
