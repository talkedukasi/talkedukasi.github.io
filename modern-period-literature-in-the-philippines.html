American Period</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Two English-language novels dealt with the war experience: (Medina, p. 194) Without Seeing the Dawn (1947) by Stevan Javellana and Watch in the Night by Edilberto Tiempo. Both books are deeply rooted in the realist tradition. Lazaro Francisco, the pre-war eminent Tagalog writer, was to continue to write important works. He rewrote Bayaning Nagpatiwakal (1932), reworking the story and, in general, honing his work as a tool against policies that appeared to maintain American economic supremacy in the Philippines. Ilaw Sa Hilaga (1948) was the title of the updated book (Lumbera, p. 67). He was supposed to write three more books. Sugat Sa Alaala (1950) depicts the horrors of war as well as the human capacity for nobility, endurance, and compassion in the most adverse conditions. The agrarian problem is addressed in Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig (1956), and the corruption bred by American-style and American-educated pseudo-reformers is addressed in Daluyong (1962). Lazaro Francisco is a social and spiritual idealist who is a realist. Rizal has had a major impact on his work.</p><p></p><br />
