One sunny day, my little puppy jumped onto our red couch and played with his new toy. I liked to watch him play and it made me feel happy? Soon my playful puppy yawned. He was a tired puppy. I picked him up and laid him on his soft, round bed. Soon, my sleepy puppy was snoring away. _______________________________________ Chilled strawberry ice cream is an amazing treat. It is very creamy and has a very smooth texture. Pineapple slices make it colorful. Strawberries add bright and red color too. It also makes an ice cream taste wonderful. White soft cream is added to make the dessert look beautiful. The ice cream is served with crispy biscuit to make it tastes more delicious. _______________________________________ Seashells belong to mollusca or mollusks. There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC). They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog, or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their roll. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. ​</a>

                                            Our Wildlife, Our Treasure 'Various sources describe wildlife as the many kinds of plants and animals that grow and live in the wild. The animals in this classification have very little contact with humans; thus, they are undomesticated or wild. Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource." Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act defines wildlife as 'wild forms and varieties of flora and fauna, in all developmental stages, including those which are in captivity or are being bred or propagated."five world plant and animals help maintain not right balance there are also use it to flow the new high birds of plant and animals and and conducting experiment this feature of filipinos when they encounter this plant and animals match 3 forever year is named word wednesday or wwd  by the united nations connected general assembly beneficial you not help and conservation ​</a>

There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC).

The animals in this classification have very little contact with humans; thus, they are undomesticated or wild. Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource." Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act defines wildlife as 'wild forms and varieties of flora and fauna, in all developmental stages, including those which are in captivity or are being bred or propagated."five world plant and animals help maintain not right balance there are also use it to flow the new high birds of plant and animals and and conducting experiment this feature of filipinos when they encounter this plant and animals match 3 forever year is named word wednesday or wwd  by the united nations connected general assembly beneficial you not help and conservation ​</h2><br />
