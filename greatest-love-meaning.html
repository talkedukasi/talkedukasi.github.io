                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

                            13. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5. How did the author related to his topic the world? ​</h2><br />
