Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay.

Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September.

Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor.
