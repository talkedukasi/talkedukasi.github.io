                                            You have learned that politics is concerned with "who gets what, when and how" as stated by Harold Lasswell. It is about human relationships and how humans behave differently when dealing with others when there is cooperation, competition, and conflict. It is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (this is usually a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. Although viewed differently by people, politics generally involves the public issues that give rise to conflict Political Science is a social science concerned chiefly with the description and analysis of political and governmental institutions and processes. Studying politics may involve the study of concepts that are universal in politics, such as power, justice and force; or the study of institutions and processes of politics.​</a>

                                            The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</a>
