LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                                            Mr and Mrs. Harris have two children who are both boys. The younger son suffers fromcomparison because he could hardly catch up with his lessons in Grade 3, while his elder brother performs exceptionally in both academics and extracurricular activities. To maks the matter worse Mr. Harris started to openly favor the elder son, but kept on insults on his younger son. Is it right for the Father to favor his elder son over the younger one? Explain your answer2. In Wambo Academy, the principal called for an emergency meeting to discuss a student who had been in Grade 3 for two consecutive years because he could hardly read and write. Added to this, he has been "misbehaving" in class because he could not catch up with the lessons. All the teachers agreed to call on the parents to advise them to find a new school for him even without getting into the real reason why he fails in all his subjects.Is it fair for the teachers to recommend the transfer of the student to another school even before they try to know the root cause of his academic failures and his 'misbehaviors"?

School from Home Should Be Implemented
Homeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented because of the threat of COVID-19.
First reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to stay at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and
evaluating​its​implementation​for​the​reason​that​homeschooling​follows​a curriculum that is approved by DepEd.
Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don’t want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case of covid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadful about the health of their children.
The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time planning and preparing a good learning modality for the sake of the students as Briones said that “Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.   pa sagot nmn po kailagan ko na po kase bukas</a>

                                            There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that a
big change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’ve
been homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me that
I’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at the
same time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.
First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. We
were on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made her
tell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told me
not to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure I
could sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first few
days. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’t
make any friends?
My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t have
worried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found out
that another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at school
since she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,
our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell

There are phones in each classroom and front office which can There has been a lot of discussion lately about whether kids should be allowed to use cell phones in be used for emergencies or to contact parents when that is needed. Phones can be a major distraction for many kids Also, these days phones can be used by some kids to bully others. Today's modern classrooms have phones that dial out. There is also a phone in the office. If someon needs to call a student's parent it can be done from one of the phones in the school in the unlikely event there is a weather emergency and power goes out, including the phone lines, all of the teachers have cell phones which they can use. There is really no reason for students to have a phone with them-up until tes years ago cell phones were not around and students managed just fine in school all day. Cell phones can be a big distraction during the school day. If kids bring their phones to class and to use them they won't be paying attention. There are too many games and apps on phones that can ou attention away from what they are supposed to be doing in school/There are already so many things th distract kids away from their lessons without adding cell phones to the mix. Cell phones are another way that kids bully each other. There are already too many ways kids mean to each other at school, phones would just add another method for mean-spirited kids to haras kids/Unfortunately, there are always a few kids who go out of their way to give others a hard time ar phones are allowed in school it will give them one more tool to use to hurt others.

Droplets that are produced when an infected personcoughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaledinto their lungs. A person infected with coronavirus -- even one with no symptoms - may emitaerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or driftaround in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and becomeinfected with the coronavirus. This is the reason why everyone should wear a mask when they goout in public. Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects, though thisis a less common way for the virus to spread.1.

                                            'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</a>

                                            Who won this year’s 7th grade race around the campus? 
Every year at Xavier School for Gifted Youngster, there is an all-class race. Below are the results for the 7th grade (which is made up of four different classes of 7th grade). But there is a problem: no one agrees on who won! One person thinks Class C should win the trophy because they had the 1st runner overall in the race. Another person thinks Class D should win because they had 3 runners come in under 10th place. A third person says: just find the average. But a 4th person said: wait a minute – D Class had way more students in their class than Class C! Averages won’t be fair. A 5th person says: use the scoring system in Cross Country – just add up the place of finish of the top 5 and lowest total wins. A 6th person says – unfair! Some classes did well in the first few runners but poorly in the middle! Why should they win? Now, everyone is confused and arguing. 
What is the most fair solution? Who should win the trophy? Your group, well-known in the school as a group of expert mathematicians (and widely known and respected for your sense of fairness) is being consulted as to who should win the trophy. What will you recommend and why?</a>

(2pts each correct answer.)School from Horne Should Be ImplementedHomeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented f the threat of COVID-19. because of thFirst reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to say at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case ofcovid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadfulabout the health of their children.The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes Instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time plarning and preparing a good learning modality for the saks of the students as Briones said that "Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.​</a>

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

The younger son suffers fromcomparison because he could hardly catch up with his lessons in Grade 3, while his elder brother performs exceptionally in both academics and extracurricular activities. To maks the matter worse Mr. Harris started to openly favor the elder son, but kept on insults on his younger son. Is it right for the Father to favor his elder son over the younger one? Explain your answer2. In Wambo Academy, the principal called for an emergency meeting to discuss a student who had been in Grade 3 for two consecutive years because he could hardly read and write. Added to this, he has been "misbehaving" in class because he could not catch up with the lessons. All the teachers agreed to call on the parents to advise them to find a new school for him even without getting into the real reason why he fails in all his subjects.Is it fair for the teachers to recommend the transfer of the student to another school even before they try to know the root cause of his academic failures and his 'misbehaviors"?

School from Home Should Be Implemented
Homeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented because of the threat of COVID-19.
First reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to stay at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and
evaluating​its​implementation​for​the​reason​that​homeschooling​follows​a curriculum that is approved by DepEd.
Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don’t want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case of covid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadful about the health of their children.
The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time planning and preparing a good learning modality for the sake of the students as Briones said that “Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.   pa sagot nmn po kailagan ko na po kase bukas</h2><br />

                            15. There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that a
big change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’ve
been homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me that
I’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at the
same time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.
First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. We
were on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made her
tell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told me
not to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure I
could sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first few
days. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’t
make any friends?
My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t have
worried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found out
that another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at school
since she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,
our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell

that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been really
nice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day.

There are phones in each classroom and front office which can There has been a lot of discussion lately about whether kids should be allowed to use cell phones in be used for emergencies or to contact parents when that is needed. Phones can be a major distraction for many kids Also, these days phones can be used by some kids to bully others. Today's modern classrooms have phones that dial out. There is also a phone in the office. If someon needs to call a student's parent it can be done from one of the phones in the school in the unlikely event there is a weather emergency and power goes out, including the phone lines, all of the teachers have cell phones which they can use. There is really no reason for students to have a phone with them-up until tes years ago cell phones were not around and students managed just fine in school all day. Cell phones can be a big distraction during the school day. If kids bring their phones to class and to use them they won't be paying attention. There are too many games and apps on phones that can ou attention away from what they are supposed to be doing in school/There are already so many things th distract kids away from their lessons without adding cell phones to the mix. Cell phones are another way that kids bully each other. There are already too many ways kids mean to each other at school, phones would just add another method for mean-spirited kids to haras kids/Unfortunately, there are always a few kids who go out of their way to give others a hard time ar phones are allowed in school it will give them one more tool to use to hurt others.

Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or driftaround in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and becomeinfected with the coronavirus.

She indulged me with stories then told menot to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure Icould sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first fewdays. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’tmake any friends?My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t haveworried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found outthat another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at schoolsince she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been reallynice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day1. What pattern of paragraph development is used in the given passage? *2.

                            21. 'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

                            24.  Activity 2. A Powerful Story “From Where I Stand” (A Gender Equality Project For the Global Goals)Directions: Read a story below. Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</h2><br />

                            26. Who won this year’s 7th grade race around the campus? 
Every year at Xavier School for Gifted Youngster, there is an all-class race. Below are the results for the 7th grade (which is made up of four different classes of 7th grade). But there is a problem: no one agrees on who won! One person thinks Class C should win the trophy because they had the 1st runner overall in the race. Another person thinks Class D should win because they had 3 runners come in under 10th place. A third person says: just find the average. But a 4th person said: wait a minute – D Class had way more students in their class than Class C! Averages won’t be fair. A 5th person says: use the scoring system in Cross Country – just add up the place of finish of the top 5 and lowest total wins. A 6th person says – unfair! Some classes did well in the first few runners but poorly in the middle! Why should they win? Now, everyone is confused and arguing. 
What is the most fair solution? Who should win the trophy? Your group, well-known in the school as a group of expert mathematicians (and widely known and respected for your sense of fairness) is being consulted as to who should win the trophy. What will you recommend and why?</h2><br />

(2pts each correct answer.)School from Horne Should Be ImplementedHomeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented f the threat of COVID-19. because of thFirst reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to say at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case ofcovid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadfulabout the health of their children.The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes Instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time plarning and preparing a good learning modality for the saks of the students as Briones said that "Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.​</h2><br />
