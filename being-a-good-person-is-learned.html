Every individual is hooked to making themselves respectable and acceptable to others. Regardless what it takes, the most important thing is to avoid prejudice. It is good that the Department of Education offered a Personal Development subject in Senior High School Curriculum. This subject seeks to help learners improve both their personality and appearance. The Department of Education sees how the whole well-being of the learner is important to the country's success as well as in relating oneself to others. Have you been in a dilemma of showing yourself to others? Why do you think being accepted by others is important? In what ways do you think a person can best present himself to others?​</a>

                                            can someone check the grammar if it’s correct? thank u
To those given by my friends and family, I learned not to be shy in everything because based on my shyness I only have a few friends, So I will give myself a chance to be confident in all things that I do. For being expensive, I learned that if it's not important, don't buy it because there are other things that need to be spent. In being annoying it is not good because not everyone you meet will like your attitude, but it depends on the person you’re with, like your family so you have 
 to control it in all times. Lastly, life taught me that we need to learn something from what we do, life doesn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.</a>

Children must build self-discipline and good habits as young as they can be if children know how to make a self-care routine, they will have a good view of life. They affect one another because if you don't have self-discipline, building good habits will not be easy, and knowing and understanding children's rights as human beings will be difficult and shallow. Remember, children should be present during grown-up talks, meddle in their conversation, or participate in it.</a>

                                            What I Have Learned
1. Society was brought by the human desire to relate with others. It is considered a product of deliberate actions by individuals who come together in pursuit of a common goal.
2. Society greatly influences the individual, as it determines to a certain extent a person’s identity. Society makes possible the emergence of certain individualities, which are the result of the person’s interaction with other members of society.
3. Philosophers consider society as a product of the “social contract”, where individuals decide to sacrifice personal interest and submit to a higher authority. Society is also rooted in the concepts of the common good and general welfare, which refers to social conditions that enable persons and groups to fulfill their goals and achieve well-being.

Respect shows that an individual values and views the other person as a worthy human being who deserves respect. ... In addition, good people are forgiving. They do not hold grudges, and let go of anger that might lead them to hurt others.</p><p></p><p>Goodness begins with a belief and ends with behavior. If you believe that you are a good person then the hard work begins. You have to turn that belief into a behaviour. ... So becoming or learning to become a good person is not to get praised by others, it is for your own self first.</p><p></p><p>#KEEPONLEARNING</p><br />

It's essential to like to help others, but it's equally important to know when to let them deal with their own problems. We need to learn to agree to disagree and give people the space they need to gain their own experiences. Ultimately, the responsibility of every citizen is to pay attention to the needs of others and to reverse the negative effects of society.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The Department of Education sees how the whole well-being of the learner is important to the country's success as well as in relating oneself to others.

To those given by my friends and family, I learned not to be shy in everything because based on my shyness I only have a few friends, So I will give myself a chance to be confident in all things that I do. For being expensive, I learned that if it's not important, don't buy it because there are other things that need to be spent. In being annoying it is not good because not everyone you meet will like your attitude, but it depends on the person you’re with, like your family so you have 
 to control it in all times. Lastly, life taught me that we need to learn something from what we do, life doesn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.</h2><br />

                            27. What I Have Learned
1. Society was brought by the human desire to relate with others. It is considered a product of deliberate actions by individuals who come together in pursuit of a common goal.
2. Society greatly influences the individual, as it determines to a certain extent a person’s identity. Society makes possible the emergence of certain individualities, which are the result of the person’s interaction with other members of society.
3. Philosophers consider society as a product of the “social contract”, where individuals decide to sacrifice personal interest and submit to a higher authority. Society is also rooted in the concepts of the common good and general welfare, which refers to social conditions that enable persons and groups to fulfill their goals and achieve well-being.
