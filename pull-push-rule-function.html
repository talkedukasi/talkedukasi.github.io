                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A test light, test lamp, voltage tester, or mains tester is a piece of electronic test equipment used to determine the presence of electricity in a piece of equipment under test.A voltmeter is an instrument that measures the difference in electrical potential between two points in an electric circuit. An analog voltmeter moves a pointer across a scale in proportion to the circuit's voltage; a digital voltmeter provides a numerical display.A push pull rule is a measuring tape that coils into a compact case. It is used for measuring long, short, straight lengths.A clamp-on ammeter is a meter that measures the current in a circuit by measuring the strength of the magnetic field around a single conductor. Clamp-on ammeters measure currents from 0.01 A or less to 1000 A or more.Wire gauge is a measurement of wire diameter. This determines the amount of electric current the wire can safely carry, as well as its electrical resistance and weight.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>S</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />
