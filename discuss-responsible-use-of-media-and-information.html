                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Try to be the master of the media you consume, not the slave. Be an active user, deliberately knowing why you’re reading certain sites and what you’re getting out of it. You might even allot portions of your web surfing to real news (global and domestic events), politics, entertainment, your professional/academic interests and personal obsessions, etc. The point is one can still enjoy trashy memes, conspiracy theory, constant reinforcement of your political bias and all the other vices to do with the availability of information…but at least try to be actively aware of what the media is doing to, and for, your mind.</p><br />
