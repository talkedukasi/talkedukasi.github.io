Write your answers in your answer sheet. 1. How does the author analyze class relations?2. What does the author say about oppression?3. Are class conflicts ignored or blamed?4. How do characters overcome oppression?5. What did Mathilde Loisel do to cover up her social status?6. What happened to Mathilde Loisel when she lost the necklace?7. What does the necklace signify?plss wag kayong troll namomoblema din kayo sa sagot Kaya wag ka na dumagdag​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. How does the author analyze class relations?</p><p>- It is her focus on social class that causes her to borrow a necklace to wear to a party to which she and her husband have been invited; in an ironic twist, this very necklace results in them becoming even lower in social class when they lose it and must work to pay for a replacement.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. What does the author say about oppression?</p><p>- If only Loisel was satisfied with her life she wouldn't have to borrow a necklace and lost it at the party then work just to pay it off only to know that it is fake.
</p><p>
</p><p>
3. Are class conflicts ignored or blamed?</p><p>- There are two primary conflicts in Guy De Maupassant's short story "The Necklace," which are the individual versus the self and the individual versus society. Mathilde Loisel's internal and external conflicts stem from her social status, her feelings of inadequacy, and society's expectations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
4. How do characters overcome oppression?</p><p>- The challenge that the Loisel's had to overcome was paying back the debt from buying a diamond necklace to replace the one Madame Loisel had lost. They overcame this challenge by working very hard for ten years; Mr. Loisel working many jobs and Madame Loisel staying home and taking care of all the difficult chores.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. What did Mathilde Loisel do to cover up her social status?</p><p>- She borrowed  her friends diamond necklace for the ball.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. What happened to Mathilde Loisel when she lost the necklace?</p><p>- When Mathilde loses the necklace, she is "thunderstruck" and begins to go in panic. Her husband goes to retrace their footsteps to find the necklace, but he comes back disappointed.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. What does the necklace signify?</p><p>- The necklace symbolizes the wealth and status that Mathilde longs for but cannot attain. The coat that her husband gives her at the end of the party symbolizes their current life, which Mathilde hates, and the mediocre social status she wants to escape from.</p><p></p><p>I'm not really sure how to answer no. 3 but I hope this helps.</p><br />

In the 1960s, with the rise of the feminist movement, critics rediscovered Chopin. “The Story of an Hour,” first published in 1894 in Vogue magazine, is one of Chopin’s briefest and most widely read stories.

                        The French government was well aware that Hugo’s funeral would attract masses of people and feared an uprising. Only a few years earlier, half a million people had shown up to pay respects to him on his seventy-ninth birthday. In an attempt to capitalize on his death, the government co-opted the service, preparing a massive tribute to the writer despite his expressed wish for a simple funeral. The only request the government honored was that he be buried in a pauper’s casket. Despite all the pomp and circumstance, it was truly a festival of the oppressed, as workers, the poor, and the exploited arrived en masse to celebrate the life and work of a man who had given voice to the voiceless.<br />
