Role: Human Resource Personnel Audience: Teacher Situation: Imagine that you were one of the people in the Human Resource group of a fast growing company in the were asked by the management to create a salary scheme for a very important job that the company would offer this year. The management gave the salary range good for 2 years, telling everyone in your group that whoever that would best benefit both the employer and the would-be employees would be given incentives. 1 Make use of all the concepts you learned on geometric sequences considering the starting salary, th frame, etc. in making different salary schemes and in deciding which one will be the best for both the employer employees 2. Prepare a visual presentation of your chosen salary scheme with the different data that were used, and all the computations done. You may include one or two salary schemes that you have prepared in your grc Rubric for the Chosen Salary Scheme and Visual Presentation Score Descriptors The salary scheme and visual presentation are completely accurate and logically presented/designed inch concepts, and computation involving geometric sequences. The scheme is advantageous to both employ The salary scheme and visual presentation are generally accurate and the presentation/design reflects u geometric sequences. Minor inaccuracies do not affect the overall results. The scheme is advantageous and employees, The salary scheme and visual presentation are generally accurate but the presentation/design lacks app sequences. The scheme is a little bit favorable to the employer. The salary scheme and visual presentation contain major inaccuracies and significant errors in some pa aut which scheme is advantageous. There are no salary scheme and visual presentation made.​</a>

The scheme is advantageous to both employer and employees. The salary scheme and visual presentation are generally accurate and the presentation/design reflects understanding of geometric sequences. Minor inaccuracies do not affect the overall results. The scheme is advantageous to both employer and employees. The salary scheme and visual presentation are generally accurate but the presentation/design lacks application of geometric sequences. The scheme is a little bit favorable to the employer. The salary scheme and visual presentation contain major inaccuracies and significant errors in some parts. One cannot figure out which scheme is advantageous.

                        <p>Answers to this question</p><p></p><p>Answer:</p><p>A scientific investigatory project (SIP) is a scientific research project typically undertaken in school as a class or term project or in a science fair or exhibition. It is meant to get school-children interested and inquisitive about science. While it is meant to be “light” and fun compared with a research project at a higher level (such as at a university or an institute), its structure and procedure are similar to that for a serious research study.</p><p> </p><p>I have outlined the broad steps below for conducting and communicating an SIP:</p><p></p><p>Come up with a research question: You come up with a scientific problem to solve. The problem should be relevant and novel. Also, you should typically do a literature search in the broad area to know more about the topic.</p><p></p><p>Frame the hypothesis: You narrow down the research question to a predicted outcome, which you need to test.</p><p></p><p>Design and conduct the study: You identify the requirements (methods, materials, and subjects as needed) and then conduct the experiment.</p><p></p><p>Analyze and discuss the results: You inspect and interpret the results, even if they are negative (that is, do not corroborate your hypothesis).</p><p></p><p>Form a conclusion based on the results: You discuss new learnings from the study and suggest possible directions for future experiments.</p><p></p><p>Write a paper based on the experiment: You write a paper synthesizing the various aspects of your study described above.</p><p></p><p>If needed, prepare a presentation and visual aid: This is not entirely applicable at a higher level, but is necessary for an SIP. You can have fun doing this, perhaps even making a 3D model.</p><p></p><p>Here are a few relevant resources from the site to get you started.

                        Noel was hired by a local petroleum refinery at a starting salary of ₱ 40,000 a month. If the company gives him a ₱ 30,000 increase in his annual salary every year, how much would he be getting at the start of his 10th year with the company? If he regularly saves 10% of his monthly salary, what will be his total savings at the start of the 10th year?<br /><br />Solution:<br /><br />From the analysis of a given word problem, this is an application of arithmetic progression because there's a common difference in the sequence which is ₱ 30,000 per year, the amount of annual salary increase of Noel. <br /><br />The initial annual salary of Noel = ₱ 40,000 (12) = ₱ 480,000.<br /><br />First, the nth term of an Arithmetic Progression is give by the formula<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />where<br /><br />a1 = first term of an arithmetic progression<br /><br />an = last term of an arithmetic progression<br /><br />n = nth term of an arithmetic progression<br /><br />d = common difference of an arithmetic progression<br /><br />In the given word problem, <br /><br />an = amount of Noel's salary at the end of his 10th year with the company<br /><br />a1 = initial salary of Noel which is ₱ 480,000<br /><br />n = number of years in working with the company which is 10 years<br /><br />d = amount of annual salary increase of Noel which is ₱ 30,000<br /><br />Substitute the given items to the above equation in order to get the amount of Noel's salary at the end of his 10th year with the company as follows<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Therefore, the amount of Noel's salary at the end of his 10th year with the company is ₱ 750,000.

different salary schemes and in deciding which one will be the best for both the
employer and the would-be employees.

done. You may include one or two salary schemes that you have prepared for
comparison. Use a cartolina or manila paper</h2><br />

                        The importance of patterns arithmetic sequence or geometric sequence ​in making a salary scheme<p>Both arithmetic and geometric sequences are important in making a salary scheme. An <strong>arithmetic sequence </strong>can be used to determine how much someone will earn over time if they receive regular raises. A <strong>geometric sequence</strong> can be used to determine how much someone will earn if their salary doubles every year.</p><p>An <strong>arithmetic sequence</strong> is a list of numbers in which each number is the previous number plus a constant. For example, the sequences 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 is an arithmetic sequence because each number is 4 more than the previous number.</p><p>A <strong>geometric sequence</strong> is a list of numbers in which each number is the previous number multiplied by a constant. For example, the sequences 2, 6, 18, 54 is a geometric sequence because each number is 3 times the previous number.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about</strong> the arithmetic sequence: https://brainly.ph/question/4958778</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
