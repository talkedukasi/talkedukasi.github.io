                        Teen pregnancy is something that has been around for ages, and isn’t all that uncommon. As of 2006, out of a million teens between the ages 15-19 three quarters of them end up pregnant every year. Out of all those teens, only a very few planned on becoming teen mothers. Through my interviews I have learned just how difficult and life changing becoming pregnant and having a baby as a teen can be. The best thing for teens to do is wait to have a baby, because having a baby this young is a lot more difficult than it looks. <br /><br />“Having a baby this young is not easy. Even though you might have your parents to help you, it’s still really hard. School becomes overly stressful and your friends drop really fast. And the boy who promised to be there forever finds a new girl. It changes your life and creates many obstacles” - Nicole. Being a teen mom you don’t get the high school or even college experiences you would have gotten if you had waited. Statistics show that most teenagers who become pregnant do not end up going to college. Girls who become pregnant as teens who had planned on going to college and getting an education have to figure out alternative solutions such as going to community college or taking classes online. The best things for teens to do is wait, wait to have a baby. Its better for them to just enjoy high school and college so they can have that experience. <br /><br />Most teen girls who end up getting pregnant and having a baby are not ready physically or mentally. <br />“Teenage years are already feel like your being judged by everyone, add a big belly and it all gets worse” - Cathy. Teens who become pregnant get looked down upon and are judged by so many people, which makes things more difficult. Plus most teen girls who end up pregnant think that just because they have a baby, the dad will stay. However in all my interviews, each lady stated how the guy left. Having a baby means growing up and taking on many responsibilities, which many teens are not ready to do at such a young age. “The second you find out your having a baby, you have to grow up right then” - Nicole. Getting pregnant as a teen changes your whole life, your forced to grow up. The best thing teens can do is to wait and just enjoy being a kid while they still can be one. One day they will have to grow up, but it doesn’t have to so soon.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>dapat mag sali sila sa mga sports activity para Malayo sila sa teenage pregnancy </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><br />Teenage pregnancy is a significant social issue that affects not only the young mothers but also their families and communities. It can lead to a host of challenges, including poor educational outcomes, limited employment opportunities, and increased health risks. As a responsible youth leader, I would encourage teenagers to prevent teenage pregnancy by providing education, awareness, and support.</p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a sensitive issue that requires a comprehensive approach to prevent it. Encouraging teenagers to avoid pregnancy is essential as it has long-term effects on their health, education, and future life opportunities. As a responsible member of society, there are several strategies that I would adopt to encourage teenagers to prevent pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>The first approach would be to educate teenagers about the risks associated with teenage pregnancy. I would emphasize that teenage pregnancy has a significant impact on their health, education, and future career opportunities. In addition, I would highlight that teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school, have poor job prospects, and suffer from poor mental health. Educating teenagers on these risks will help them make informed decisions about their lives.</p><p></p><p>The second strategy would be to provide access to contraception. I would educate teenagers on different types of contraceptives and the importance of using them. Providing access to contraceptives is crucial as it prevents unwanted pregnancies and reduces the risk of sexually transmitted infections. I would also emphasize that contraceptive use does not encourage sexual activity but rather ensures responsible sexual behavior.</p><p></p><p>The third strategy would be to provide support to teenagers who are already parents. I would provide resources such as parenting classes, healthcare services, and access to social support networks. Supporting teenage parents is crucial as it ensures that they have the necessary skills and resources to raise their children.</p><p></p><p>The fourth strategy would be to create a safe environment for teenagers to discuss sexual issues. I would encourage teenagers to ask questions and seek advice on sexual matters. Creating a safe environment for discussions on sexual issues enables teenagers to make informed decisions on sexual matters.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, I would involve parents and guardians in the prevention of teenage pregnancy. Parents and guardians play a crucial role in shaping the behavior of teenagers. I would educate parents and guardians on the importance of discussing sexual matters with their children. In addition, I would encourage parents and guardians to monitor the behavior of their children to ensure that they engage in responsible sexual behavior.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these strategies, I would also encourage teenagers to develop healthy relationships with their peers and romantic partners. This can help them make responsible decisions about their sexual health and avoid situations that could lead to unintended pregnancies. As a youth leader, I would also strive to be a positive role model for young people, demonstrating responsible behavior and encouraging them to make informed decisions about their sexual health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, preventing teenage pregnancy requires a comprehensive approach that involves education, access to contraceptives, support for teenage parents, creating a safe environment for discussions on sexual matters, and involving parents and guardians. As a responsible member of society, it is crucial to encourage teenagers to prevent teenage pregnancy as it has long-term effects on their health, education, and future life opportunities. By adopting these strategies, we can reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and ensure that teenagers have the necessary skills and resources to lead fulfilling lives.</p><br />

                        Teen pregnancy is something that has been around for ages, and isn’t all that uncommon. As of 2006, out of a million teens between the ages 15-19 three quarters of them end up pregnant every year. Out of all those teens, only a very few planned on becoming teen mothers. Through my interviews I have learned just how difficult and life changing becoming pregnant and having a baby as a teen can be. The best thing for teens to do is wait to have a baby, because having a baby this young is a lot more difficult than it looks. <br /><br />“Having a baby this young is not easy. Even though you might have your parents to help you, it’s still really hard. School becomes overly stressful and your friends drop really fast. And the boy who promised to be there forever finds a new girl. It changes your life and creates many obstacles” - Nicole. Being a teen mom you don’t get the high school or even college experiences you would have gotten if you had waited. Statistics show that most teenagers who become pregnant do not end up going to college. Girls who become pregnant as teens who had planned on going to college and getting an education have to figure out alternative solutions such as going to community college or taking classes online. The best things for teens to do is wait, wait to have a baby. Its better for them to just enjoy high school and college so they can have that experience. <br /><br />Most teen girls who end up getting pregnant and having a baby are not ready physically or mentally. <br />“Teenage years are already feel like your being judged by everyone, add a big belly and it all gets worse” - Cathy. Teens who become pregnant get looked down upon and are judged by so many people, which makes things more difficult. Plus most teen girls who end up pregnant think that just because they have a baby, the dad will stay. However in all my interviews, each lady stated how the guy left. Having a baby means growing up and taking on many responsibilities, which many teens are not ready to do at such a young age. “The second you find out your having a baby, you have to grow up right then” - Nicole. Getting pregnant as a teen changes your whole life, your forced to grow up. The best thing teens can do is to wait and just enjoy being a kid while they still can be one. One day they will have to grow up, but it doesn’t have to so soon.<br />

                        <p>Education/Knowledge</p><br /><p>From a young age, it is important that young children and adolescents have a reliable and trustworthy adult to confide in. Having an approachable and knowledgeable role model or adult in your life will greatly decrease the chances of teen pregnancy. Parents often neglect explaining the anatomy of the body to their children, however providing this information and educating children during their youth is an extremely important protective factor against teen pregnancy.</p><br /><p>Children need to grow up having a positive self-image as well as a healthy environment to grow up in. Children need unconditional love and support from their parents as it is critical in ensuring the child makes better choices about their future sexual activity. Having love from one's parents ensures that these adolescents are not left feeling unwanted from parents who are very passive and uninvolved.</p><br />

This method is the only one that guarantees no risk of getting pregnant and protects the teen from getting any STD's. </p><p></p><p>For many years abstinence has been viewed as a decision based upon a religious or moral belief. In the article "Promotion of Sexual Abstinence: Reducing Adolescent Sexual Activity and Pregnancies," Hani R. Khouzam says, "Sexual abstinence is not associated with public health risks and needs to be presented and promoted as the most effective primary prevention for unplanned pregnancies" (2). </p><p></p><p>In this article, Dr. Joycelyn Elders proposes teaching sexual abstinence as prevention for pregnancy, not as a religious or moral belief. According to Khouzam, in a study involving 7,000 Utah teens, the students were taught one of three abstinence curriculums stressing abstinence as a pregnancy prevention method. </p><p></p><p>They were surveyed three times based on their attitudes on the issue. After taking the abstinence curriculum, the studies found that from these students, a significantly higher percentage of them remained virgins than those who did not go through the program (2). </p><p></p><p>With results like this, it becomes evident that abstinence courses in schools are a sure way to get teens to realize the responsibility that comes with becoming sexually active, and to get them thinking about choosing to remain abstinent. The more information teenagers are given on the subject, the higher the chances that they will make this decision. </p><p></p><p>For this reason, it is important that teenagers be taught the health benefits of choosing to remain abstinent.</p><p></p><p>Another form of teenage pregnancy prevention that is being taught in schools is various contraceptive techniques. </p><p></p><p>Although abstinence remains the best way to prevent pregnancy among teens, it is a fact that there are still a large number of them who will be involved in sexual relations. </p><p></p><p>For this reason, it is important that teens be provided with broad information on how to do so responsibly using various contraceptive techniques. </p><p></p><p>Most of the sex education in schools consists of one message: "Don't have sex--but if you do, use a condom" (Khouzam 3).</p><p></p><p> The problem that rises from this is that teenagers are not being exposed to extensive information on the various forms of birth control, condoms, and other methods of prevention that are available.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>hope will help pa brainliest<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Teen pregnancy is a crisis that concerns the baby, parents, other members of the family, as well as resources of the community. Every year, approximately 750,000 women aged 15 to 19 become pregnant every year.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, despite the numerous elements that can influence teen pregnancy, for many teenagers, the lack of safe sex education from schools, parents, or otherwise is the root cause of teenage pregnancy. Generally, teenagers are not taught regarding the means of birth control and how to respond with friends who compel them into having sexual intercourse before they are prepared.</p><p></p><p>Teen pregnancies carry additional risk equally to the health of the infant and the mother. On the average, teen pregnancies are more expected to result in low-birth-weight babies and premature births. This is because pregnant teenagers often do not obtain the timely prenatal care required. In addition, the aforesaid teenagers have a higher risk of high blood pressures associated to their pregnancy and other related complications. Further, teenage mothers are less expected than other women to complete or attend college, and divorce is more expected to result from their early marriage. Abortion is another effect of teenage pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>Given with these numerous effects of teenage pregnancy, I think that the society here in the Philippines still does not accept this issue. Especially the Church. Having premarital Sex is wrong in any aspect, it is forbidden. Since the Philippines is considered as a Christian Country. </p><br />

                        TEENAGE PREGNANCY ESSAY (786 words)<br /><br />Pregnancy in girls aged 19 or below is termed as teenage pregnancy. There are many social, emotional and health problems associated with teenage pregnancy. Even though increased awareness about sexual health and greater used of condoms has brought down the cases of teenage pregnancy in countries like U.S., the responsible factors like low education standards, poverty, inappropriate knowledge of sex amongst adolescents contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />Some developing nations are faced with problems of early marriage and non-awareness about contraceptives which also contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />Since unplanned sexual intercourse is more common in age group 12-14 who are not aware of protected sex, the concern becomes grave for younger girls who get pregnant. If an adolescent girl gets pregnant in such an early age, abortion is one option to be considered if the pregnancy is tested and detected in time.<br /><br />In cases where girl is in later adolescence, adoption or support of community to raise the child are some ways to help the teen pregnant emotionally and also if she is financially incapable of nurturing a child. It is highly important to seek support from parents of the girl or the father of the expected child so that appropriate prenatal care can be offered. It is essential that teenage mothers stay away from smoking, drug abuse and so on.<br /><br />Teenage mothers may not be educated enough and have complete awareness about precautions to be taken during pregnancy. It becomes therefore essential to offer education and community support to such young girls and also create awareness about contraception to keep them safe from any such experience later upon.<br /><br />Pregnancy in teenage is also a very troubling time for parents of the teenager who have dreamt a bright future ahead for their children. However since the teenager who gets pregnant also undergoes feelings of anger and frustration for the situation that has arrived, it is important that parents keep their anger in control so as to reduce the adolescent’s stress.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />The parents should get complete medical check up done for the child by a qualified physician in the field and ensure that she gets counseling as well from outside if needed to overcome emotional stress. If both the families of the girl and boy are ready to raise the child properly, it is good. Else adoption should be chosen as the way where some appropriate organization should be chosen to adopt the child.<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is not socially acceptable in many communities and cultures and therefore the social problems needed to be considered besides giving medical and pre-natal care to the expecting adolescent girl. Children who are born to teenage parents are more likely to face problems with good education because social support may lack in their case. If appropriate community support is offered through child-care support and social services, such children can also get good education and settle as independently earning individuals in the society.<br /><br />A teenage pregnancy is certainly debilitating for the girl child who is often faced with societal and family pressure because of the indiscretion that resulted into her pregnancy. If a teenage girl suffers all the hostility from friends and family, she is not likely to understand and know the aspects of nutrition associated with pregnancy and may give birth to low-weight or malnourished child. Behavioral problems are also common in such children as they do not get to witness the right parental skills that they can imitate.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy becomes an issue of embarrassment for most parents and as a result they do not find it easy to accept the situation and deal with it positively and patiently. Moreover a teen girl is also not bodily prepared to give birth to a child that adds to all other problems that she faces.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />It is important that such teen parents reenter educational institutions after giving birth to the child so that they can be educated about being better parents in rearing their child. Child care should be accessible and within financial reach of such teen mothers. Many teen parents begin to abuse their children as early as 6 months of age if they also suffered abuse as children. Even more there are higher chances of death associated with teenage pregnancy for the mother as well as the child.<br /><br />Therefore early prenatal care is essential to save the child as well as mother from any complications or serious medical conditions.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy prevention programs like abstinence education, knowledge based programs that guide them about their bodies, clinic focused programs for easier access to sex education and peer counseling programs are some measures that can help control the teenage pregnancy rates in the world.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The main reason of teenage pregnancy is the lack of parental guidance. Nowadays, teens do what they see in social medias and other medias that they think is cool. Another reason is the lack of sex education. We need to enlighten the teens because this generation is so much different than the others because teens now are more curious and bolder about doing such things.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, teen pregnancy is becoming more and more common throughout the world. So many people frown upon this whole idea. Such people act as if the teenage parents’ world is going to come to an end. Although these kids’ life is going to be making a big turn, there are many of them who are mature enough to take on the responsibilities of a baby. As the medical field advances, the ways to avoid teen pregnancy goes up as well. There are ways such as abortion, plan B pills, and birth control. Some people use this because they know they are not ready to become parents, which I feel is a good and responsible choice. On the other hand, those who use these methods as a way to technically “kill” the unborn is what should be frowned upon instead</p><p></p><p></p><br />
