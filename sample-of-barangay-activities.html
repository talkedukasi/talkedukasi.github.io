If anything, this should serve as an open call to politicians at the higher echelon of the government that whoever wins in the upcoming elections-whether or not they come from the same political camp-the people should be at the fore of their priorities.Therefore, citizens must take the upcoming barangay elections seriously. They must educate themselves about the qualifications and platforms of each candidate, attend campaign rallies, debates, and town hall meetings, and engage with fellow residents to discuss the issues and concerns affecting their community. Their active participation and engagement are crucial to achieving the kind of progress and development that will genuinely serve their interests.Taken from "Barangay elections 2023: Why Filipinos should engage and vote", published on May 3, 2023, https://opinion.inquirer.netWord entryParts of SpeechMeaningSimilar wordRestrictive LabelGuide wordsReference usedWord used in my "own" sentence​</a>

                                            Random Sampling In research, collecting data can either be done in the entire population or the subset of this population called sample. If a researcher opts to use sample rather than a population, he must take considerations on the number of samples and how these samples can be chosen out of his target population. A population includes all of its elements from a set of data. The size of the population is the number of observations in the population. For example, if ABS-CBN network has 11,000 employees having the required blood type in a certain study, then we have a population of size 11,000. Sample consists of one or more data drawn from the population. It is a subset, or an incomplete set taken from a population of objects or observations. Taking samples instead of the population is less time-consuming and cost-effective. Although sampling has advantages, it can also be a source of bias and inaccuracy. Random Sampling is a sampling method of choosing representatives from the population wherein every sample has an equal chance of being selected. Accurate data can be collected using random sampling techniques. Activity Analyze the following scenarios then answer the questions that follow. a.

They must educate themselves about the qualifications and platforms of each candidate, attend campaign rallies, debates, and town hall meetings, and engage with fellow residents to discuss the issues and concerns affecting their community. Their active participation and engagement are crucial to achieving the kind of progress and development that will genuinely serve their interests.Taken from "Barangay elections 2023: Why Filipinos should engage and vote", published on May 3, 2023, https://opinion.inquirer.netWord entryParts of SpeechMeaningSimilar wordRestrictive LabelGuide wordsReference usedWord used in my "own" sentence​</h2><br />

                            17. Random Sampling In research, collecting data can either be done in the entire population or the subset of this population called sample. If a researcher opts to use sample rather than a population, he must take considerations on the number of samples and how these samples can be chosen out of his target population. A population includes all of its elements from a set of data. The size of the population is the number of observations in the population. For example, if ABS-CBN network has 11,000 employees having the required blood type in a certain study, then we have a population of size 11,000. Sample consists of one or more data drawn from the population. It is a subset, or an incomplete set taken from a population of objects or observations. Taking samples instead of the population is less time-consuming and cost-effective. Although sampling has advantages, it can also be a source of bias and inaccuracy. Random Sampling is a sampling method of choosing representatives from the population wherein every sample has an equal chance of being selected. Accurate data can be collected using random sampling techniques. Activity Analyze the following scenarios then answer the questions that follow. a. As of May 6, 2020, the Department of Health recorded 131,786 unique individuals who got tested for the COVID-19 out of approximately 109,369,019 Filipinos. Identify the population. How many elements are there in the population? Who are the samples? How many samples are selected? Did the situation illustrate random sampling? Why or why not? b.
