                                            Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</a>
