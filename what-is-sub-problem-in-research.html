                                            Research design is the framework of research methods and techniques chosen by a researcher. The design allows researchers to hone in on research methods that are suitable for the subject matter and set up their studies up for success. The design of a research topic explains the type of research(experimental, survey, correlational, semi-experimental, review) and also its sub-type(experimental design, research problem, and descriptive case-study).There are three main types of research design: Data collection, measurement, and analysis.

                            15. Research design is the framework of research methods and techniques chosen by a researcher. The design allows researchers to hone in on research methods that are suitable for the subject matter and set up their studies up for success. The design of a research topic explains the type of research(experimental, survey, correlational, semi-experimental, review) and also its sub-type(experimental design, research problem, and descriptive case-study).There are three main types of research design: Data collection, measurement, and analysis.
