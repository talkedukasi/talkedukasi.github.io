                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Drawing conclusion</strong> is a type of  <strong>interpretative thinking.</strong></p><p>Before coming up with a conclusion, you have to gather as much information as you can. And not just "any information," because you need to only get "<strong>relevant</strong> <strong>information</strong>." Without gathering relevant information, you will have difficulty doing inferences, because conclusion is based on that.</p><p>It is like connecting dots based on your gathered information. After this, you can now dig deeper and discover new insights. You use facts and logic in order to come up with interpretation. </p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong> is a <strong>logical analytical</strong> <strong>conclusion</strong>. Your interpretation will depend on the implications, impacts, and/or significance of the issue at hand. When you're done gathering information, it's now time to ask: What now? What can we draw from this? What can we infer from this? </p><p>Answering these will make you arrive to drawing conclusion.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn</strong> <strong>more</strong>:</p><p>brainly.ph/question/1677182</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

</p>Activity 1. Showcasing Learned Concepts
Directions: Expound or explain with great detail the following expressions
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Conclusion as interpretative thinking </strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Conclusion is a sort of interpretive or analytical reasoning which draws its relevance, authenticity, or appropriateness from sensations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Conclusion as valid and true</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If a statement is true, it is legitimate and has most of the necessary implications. Because the argument is valid, it follows that if all of the conditions are true, the conclusion must also be accurate.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. Best evidence</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The term "best evidence," sometimes known as "primary evidence," refers specifically to an original manuscript that is the most credible proof of its presence and characteristics.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>4. Conclusion in relation to the review of related literature</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>The significant arguments and discrepancies in the literature should be summarized in your conclusion.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. Conclusion in relation to themes and patterns</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your plotlines are interconnected since you can't write a conclusion without them.
