Are you both proud for the same reasons?I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia A. ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.Learning Task 1:After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.LEARNING TASK 1After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

                                            The Sun and the Moon (Bagobo Tradition) Long ago the Sun had to leave the Moon to go to another town. He knew that his wife, the Moon, was expecting the birth of a child; and, before going away, he said to her, "When your baby is born, if it is a boy, keep it; if a girl, kill it." A long time passed before the Sun could come back to the Moon, and while he was gone, the Moon gave birth to her baby. It was a girl. A beautiful child it was, with curly hair like binubbud, with burnished nails that looked like gold, and having the white spots called pamoti on its body. The mother felt very sad to think of killing it, and so she hid it in the big box (kaban) where they kept their clothes. As soon as the Sun returned, he asked the Moon, "How about our baby?" At once the Moon replied, "It was a girl: I killed it yesterday." The Sun had only a week to stay at home with the Moon. One night he dreamed that a boy with white hair came to him from heaven. The boy stood close to him, and spoke these words:- "Your wife got a baby, but it was a girl; and she hid it away from you in the box." When the Sun wakened from sleep, he was very angry at the Moon, and the two fell to quarrelling about the baby. The Moon wanted the child saved. "You ought to keep it with you," she urged. "No, no!" protested the Sun. "I cannot keep it, because my body is so hot it would make your baby sick." "And I cannot keep it," complained the Moon, "for my body is very dark; and that would surely make the child sick." Then the Sun fell into a passion of rage; and he seized his big kampilan, and slew the child. He cut its small body into numberless little bits, as many as the grains of sand that lie along the seashore. Out of the window he tossed the pieces of the shining little body; and, as the gleaming fragments sparkled to their places in the sky, the stars came to birth. 1.

                                            A Strong and Beautiful People From the Filipino Legend of "Malakas and Maganda" H. P. Ladera Legend has it that once upon a time, long, long, ago, there lived a maid and a man who loved each other dearly. It is said that Malakas and Maganda were born on the same night, at the same hour just as the new moon was rising. And their people, whose loves were ruled by the movements of the sun and the stars and the moon, knew that this strange coincidence has a wondrous meaning. And even as they worshiped the newly-born babies, their diviners decreed that Bathala, in his mysterious wisdom, must have meant them for each other. And so it came to pass that the two kingdoms which were rule by the parents of Malakas and Maganda held an joint festival to celebrate the double birth. And at this festival, Malakas and Maganda were promised to each other. They would be married after fifteen years. However, on the night of their birth, a seer had prophesied that their marriage would not come true because an evil bird had sung. So, famine and drought delayed their marriage for three years. Finally, when the night of their wedding had come and both kingdoms were getting ready for the great feast, fears of war between the two kingdoms, one as strong as the other, did not augur well for the occasion. Malakas, came secretly to see Maganda, to tell her about his fears, but the he assured her he loved her and that nothing would ever separate them. Everyone thought they were so right for each other No other love was more powerful than theirs. Besides, the young and the romantic thought that their marriage was written in the stars. At the marriage festival, the two rajahs, parents of the bride and groom, had confrontation over the disputed ancestral lands. There was no wedding. As the two kingdoms separated. They couldn't understand how some old hill could destroy a friendship of many, many years. To Malakas and Maganda, however, their love had grown stronger than it was before. They knew in their hearts they would find a way. One night, when her father was out, Prncess Maganda escaped from home and sought out Prince Malakas. Afraid that Maganda might not get another chance to escape, together, they ran away to distant lands. Legend says, they became parents of the first Filipinos. Their union gave birth to a strong and beautiful people. what is the possible questions?​</a>

Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and the shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round. 2) It all started as a philosophical concept developed by the Greeks around the 6th century BC. It wasn't until the 3rd century BC when Ancient astronomy came to the conclusion that the earth was in fact physically spherical. 3)The round Earth theory didn't get a proper explanation until Aristotle (384-322 BC) made three important observations. 4) The Greeks are very much noted for their major contributions in different fields. They were not only great philosophers. They were great scientists and mathematicians as well. It was in Greece that the Golden Age of early astronomy was centered. 5)At first, there was no real explanation of how the Greeks came up with this conclusion, other than their observation on the change of the stars when they traveled​</a>

 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</a>

Text 1.___________ Tungkung Langit and Alunsina
Origin: Visayas, Panay
Another creator and counterpart to the likes of Bathala and Kan-Laon, Tungkung
Langit created order out of chaos. He is industrious and loyal but despite his
efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</a>

You must not go!”“I have made my decision,” said the Mouse firmly. “I have never seen the ocean, and it’s high time that I did. Nothing can make me change my mind.”“Then we cannot stop you,” said the Mother and Father Mouse, “but do be careful!”The next day, in the first light of dawn, the Mouse began his journey. Even before the morning had ended, the Mouse came to know trouble and fear.A Cat jumped out from behind a tree.“I will eat you for lunch,” he said.It was a narrow escape for the Mouse. He ran for his life, but he left a part of his tail in the mouth of the Cat.By afternoon the Mouse had been attacked by birds and dogs. He had lost his way several times. He was bruised and bloodied. He was tired and frightened.At evening the Mouse slowly climbed the last hill and saw the seashore spreading out before him. He watched the waves rolling onto the beach, one after another. All the colors of the sunset filled the sky. “How beautiful!” cried the Mouse. “I wish that Mother and Father were here to see this with me.”The moon and the stars began to appear over the ocean. The Mouse sat silently on the top of the hill. He was overwhelmed by a feeling of deep peace and contentment. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Islands are described in the poem as "rippled with sun, where days are green fires and with warm nights"It is true that these were done by many Filipinos in the past and there are until now, I agree, but we Filipinos have also improved and there are a lot of us now who are professionals in almost every work aspect.It is said in the poem that the cure for the ills of man is "grandeur of charity and peace". And yes, I agree with us helping one another and spreading peace all throughout, evil will surely subside.Yes, it is a responsibility, to walk chin up, full of confidence and to proudly say "I am a Filipino", when asked of race, to say that "I am dark-skinned, hardworking, and a <strong>FILIPI</strong><strong>NO</strong>, and I will always be proud of it", to show our appreciation and undying respect of our culture,country,and people.All of it still lives, except the fact that the number of people who willingly show these traits have decreased.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>These answers contain my opinions, so feel free to change them...</p><p></p><p>Please do not that I am not a genius and that my answers are not 100% accurate...</p><p></p><p>#Goodluck!</p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />

For some time she pounded the rice, and then she raised the pestle so high that it struck the sky very hard. Immediately the sky began to rise,2 and it went up so far that she lost her ornaments.

                            19. The Sun and the Moon (Bagobo Tradition) Long ago the Sun had to leave the Moon to go to another town. He knew that his wife, the Moon, was expecting the birth of a child; and, before going away, he said to her, "When your baby is born, if it is a boy, keep it; if a girl, kill it." A long time passed before the Sun could come back to the Moon, and while he was gone, the Moon gave birth to her baby. It was a girl. A beautiful child it was, with curly hair like binubbud, with burnished nails that looked like gold, and having the white spots called pamoti on its body. The mother felt very sad to think of killing it, and so she hid it in the big box (kaban) where they kept their clothes. As soon as the Sun returned, he asked the Moon, "How about our baby?" At once the Moon replied, "It was a girl: I killed it yesterday." The Sun had only a week to stay at home with the Moon. One night he dreamed that a boy with white hair came to him from heaven. The boy stood close to him, and spoke these words:- "Your wife got a baby, but it was a girl; and she hid it away from you in the box." When the Sun wakened from sleep, he was very angry at the Moon, and the two fell to quarrelling about the baby. The Moon wanted the child saved. "You ought to keep it with you," she urged. "No, no!" protested the Sun. "I cannot keep it, because my body is so hot it would make your baby sick." "And I cannot keep it," complained the Moon, "for my body is very dark; and that would surely make the child sick." Then the Sun fell into a passion of rage; and he seized his big kampilan, and slew the child. He cut its small body into numberless little bits, as many as the grains of sand that lie along the seashore. Out of the window he tossed the pieces of the shining little body; and, as the gleaming fragments sparkled to their places in the sky, the stars came to birth. 1.

Ladera Legend has it that once upon a time, long, long, ago, there lived a maid and a man who loved each other dearly. It is said that Malakas and Maganda were born on the same night, at the same hour just as the new moon was rising. And their people, whose loves were ruled by the movements of the sun and the stars and the moon, knew that this strange coincidence has a wondrous meaning. And even as they worshiped the newly-born babies, their diviners decreed that Bathala, in his mysterious wisdom, must have meant them for each other. And so it came to pass that the two kingdoms which were rule by the parents of Malakas and Maganda held an joint festival to celebrate the double birth. And at this festival, Malakas and Maganda were promised to each other. They would be married after fifteen years. However, on the night of their birth, a seer had prophesied that their marriage would not come true because an evil bird had sung. So, famine and drought delayed their marriage for three years. Finally, when the night of their wedding had come and both kingdoms were getting ready for the great feast, fears of war between the two kingdoms, one as strong as the other, did not augur well for the occasion. Malakas, came secretly to see Maganda, to tell her about his fears, but the he assured her he loved her and that nothing would ever separate them. Everyone thought they were so right for each other No other love was more powerful than theirs. Besides, the young and the romantic thought that their marriage was written in the stars. At the marriage festival, the two rajahs, parents of the bride and groom, had confrontation over the disputed ancestral lands. There was no wedding. As the two kingdoms separated. They couldn't understand how some old hill could destroy a friendship of many, many years. To Malakas and Maganda, however, their love had grown stronger than it was before. They knew in their hearts they would find a way. One night, when her father was out, Prncess Maganda escaped from home and sought out Prince Malakas. Afraid that Maganda might not get another chance to escape, together, they ran away to distant lands. Legend says, they became parents of the first Filipinos.

 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</h2><br />

Ill give brainliest for who answers first(excerpt from) The Creation James Weldon Johnson  AND God stepped out on space,And He looked around and said,“I’m lonely—I’ll make me a world.”And far as the eye of God could see5Darkness covered everything,Blacker than a hundred midnightsDown in a cypress swamp.Then God smiled,And the light broke,10And the darkness rolled up on one side,And the light stood shining on the other,And God said, “That’s good!”Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,And God rolled the light around in His hands15Until He made the sun;And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.And the light that was left from making the sunGod gathered it up in a shining ballAnd flung it against the darkness,20Spangling the night with the moon and stars.Then down betweenThe darkness and the lightHe hurled the world;And God said, “That’s good!”25Then God himself stepped down—And the sun was on His right hand,And the moon was on His left;The stars were clustered about His head,And the earth was under His feet.30And God walked, and where He trodHis footsteps hollowed the valleys ouyAnd bulged the mountains up.Then He stopped and looked and sawThat the earth was hot and barren.35So God stepped over to the edge of the worldAnd He spat out the seven seas;He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;And the waters above the earth came down,40The cooling waters came down.How does the poem's "free verse" structure help to express the theme of the poem? a) its lack of rhyme scheme shows that god prefers chaos. b) its rhyme scheme shows god's interest in order and harmony. c) its tight structure shows that god has to obey certain rules. d) its lack of structure underlines the fact that god can do anything.</h2><br />

Text 1.___________ Tungkung Langit and Alunsina
Origin: Visayas, Panay
Another creator and counterpart to the likes of Bathala and Kan-Laon, Tungkung
Langit created order out of chaos. He is industrious and loyal but despite his
efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</h2><br />
