What is the one generalidea? = The general idea in the story is face the reality because in the last line of the story the author said " the bread was not yet ready " so it means that the bread simbolizes the boy .

One of the example is his dream of being together with Aida and being professional Violinist but would not be happen in the future. He accepts the things that may not be happen but that he did not realize that God has a better plan for him becausehe was still young . 2. Is the main character kinetic: that is, does he or she change during the story? ( If he or she stays the same, we call the characteristic static.) = The main character is Kinetic because he change in the end of the story from his dream to be a professional violinist and his dream to be with the girl named Aida waking up from a long night fantasy .

Is the conflict external, that is, betweenone characterand some outside force (nature, society, oranother character), or is the conflict internal, within one character? = The conflict is when his aunt does not supporthim to perform in public or parties because the musician are the last to eat during parties. The conflict is external because is between one character and some outside force like Man vs Society or Man vs Circumstances. 5. What is the climax or the high point of the story? = The climax of the story is when Aida caught him packing some of the food in the party he walked out with shame. He was probably thinking that becauseof what he had done, there is no chance for Aida to like him back. 6. Describe the setting of the story. How would the story be different if the setting were to change? = The first setting of the story is in the Bakeshop then next in schooluntil it went to Aida' house for the party but in the ending of the story is back in the first place where the story start.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The Bread of Salt" is a short story written by N.V.M. Gonzalez. The denouement of a story is the part where the conflict is resolved, and the loose ends are tied up. In the case of "The Bread of Salt," the denouement occurs near the end of the story when the protagonist, a young boy named Alfredo, finally realizes that he has been infatuated with a young girl named Aida, who is the niece of the homeowners where he delivers bread.</p><p></p><p>In the story's climax, Alfredo attends a party at the house of the girl he loves, hoping to see her. However, he is disappointed when he discovers that Aida has no interest in him and is in fact in love with another man. This realization leads to the denouement of the story, as Alfredo's illusions are shattered, and he is forced to confront the harsh reality of his situation.</p><p></p><p>The final scene of the story shows Alfredo returning home from the party, disillusioned and disappointed. As he reflects on his experiences, he realizes that his infatuation with Aida was merely a fantasy and that he must accept the reality of his life as a poor baker's boy. This realization represents the denouement of the story, as Alfredo's internal conflict is resolved, and he learns an important lesson about the nature of love and life.</p><br />

natatanaw sa nayon ay ilang punong niyog at ang kampanaryo sa lumang simbahang
bato. Sa gawing kanan ay naroon ang dagat-dagatan na kinasasalaminan ng araw ng
papalubog. Ang murang bughaw na kulay ng tubig ay napalitan ng maningning na
pilak; yaon ay napakarikit sa pangmalas, kaya’t biglang-biglang aking nadamang
ako’y hindio handa upang magmasid sa gayong lalang ang kalikasan. Ako’y laging
nasa lunsod at ang aking paniniwala’y doon lamang may pintig ang buhay at
kaipala’y doon lamang mananatili sa mga panahong ito ng digmaan; ngunit kakaiba
ang nakita ko ngayon sa nayon: namumulaklak na mga punong manga sa tabing-daan,
matatabang kalabaw nag nagsisipanginain sa mga bukiring hindi pa inaararo, at
mga lalaki at babaing nagsisigawa sa kanilang mga itikan. Saan man ako tumingin
ay pulit-pulit iyon: sa mga batang namimingwit, at lalong malapit sa akin, sa
pawisan at payat na kabayong humihila sa karitela. Mandi’y kaayusan, at ako’y
nakaramdam ng pagkahiya dahil sa paniniwala sa isang uri ng buhay na salat sa
katotohanan at kaipala’y lisya.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> Sa wakas ay nalalapit na kami sa nayon.
Naraanan naming ang isang kiskisan, sumunod ay isang bahay-paaralan na
tinitirahan ng ilang pag-anakang nagsilikas sa pook na iyon; at isang bahay na
nababakurang mabuti ng kaipala’y sa isang manggagamot sapagkat may mga guhit na
krus sa pula sa tabing ng durungawan. Dumating kami sa tulay na kawayan; kami’y
nagsibabang lahat. Ang mga kaangkas ko, anim silang lahat, ay nagdaan sa may
bambang at sila’y lumusong sa tubig. Ayokong magbasa ng paa, kaya sa tawiran
ako nagdaan kahit magbayad ng isang pera sa pagtawid. </p>

<p>Ilan pang

isang karihan at isang butika, at pagkatapos ay isang bahay na yari sa table at
kawayan at pinagmumulang ng mga tinig ng nagsisipaglaro ng mahjong. Naririnig
ang isang mainam na awitin buhat sa isang bahay na malapit ngunit hindi ko
matiyak kung saan, at tatlo o apat na karitela ang yao’t ditto sa lansangan,
naghahanap ng pasahero. Sa malayo ay nagtatago sa kabila ng hanay ng mga dampa
ng mga mangingisda ang isang bahagi ng dagat-dagatan. Ang tubig ay muling
nag-iba ng kulay; ngayon ay mangitim-ngitim na ang dating pinilakan. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Takipsilim
na noo at sa kabutihang-palad ay hindi ako nahirapan sa paghahanap ng nais kong
patunguhan. Sa simula ay inaakala kong yaon ay ang bahay na nasa dulo ng
napasukan kong isang makipot at mabatong daan na kinaroroonan ng isang poso
artesyano; subali,nagkamali ako sapagkat hindi pa ako nakalalayo ay narinig
kong may tumatawag sa aking pangalan, at natalos ko agad kung sino iyon.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Bread of Salt Summary</p><p>As an author, N.V.M. Gonzalez usually wrote about the Filipino life and Filipinos in general. One of his most remarkable short stories is “The Bread of Salt”. The story is about a young boy who was very much in love with a girl named Aida but he was turned down mainly because of the difference in class that he later realized. However, this story is unlike any other typical love story. In fact, story is talks more about the painful realization of the young boy who was blinded from reality. In opening scene, we are told about the great Spanish house where Aida lived and from the line “I often wondered whether I was being depended upon to spend the years ahead in the service of this great house”, it clearly shows the difference of their classes. As we all know, in the real world, classes are a hindrance to love and marriage which the boy failed to realize from the very start because of his young age. Young boys naturally tend to think.</p><p></p><p>one of his dreams was becoming a rich and famous violinist. As we can see, the boy's experience to find out the truth is really painful, that even at the last part; it was quoted "the bread is not ready", which suggests that the boy is not quite ready to accept the real world. The pan de sal symbolizes the boy and by giving the task of buying the the pan de sal every morning to the girl, it shows how he is trying to escape from the reality so he could concentrate more on his dreams. He had wrongly regarded Aida as "his world" and thus it was painful to finally realize that he has no chance. He also had so many plans for Aida, including writing love letters and buying her a brooch. Unfortunately, how could one concentrate on his dreams if he is only at the aged of fourteen and has not even finished studying? Finally in the last part, the turning point of the story, where he hid the "egg yolks dip in honey and peppermint" in his pocket, he was caught by Aida. He has even thought of marrying Aida in the future. In the middle part of the story, the boy was relieved and was happy when he found out that her aunt brought a maid with her and that, his task of buying pan de sal every morning is now given to the "poor girl". This just shows that no matter how hard he tries to hide his "true" self, it will eventually, one day, come out. These things clearly show that the boy was very much in love with Aida so much so that he forgot that in this world not all dreams really come true. revolves around them and this is why the young boy had a lot of dreams and plans. He had already felt like he was part of the "higher class" since he was invited to the party but the truth is, his not. Some can be full of joy and happiness others not but no matter what, the realities of this world often dictates what will and must happen. If from the very start, the boy had accepted the realities of this world, maybe he would not have been to "hurt" at the last part.</p><br />
