How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

                            9. A. Identify the citing sources from the excerpts below.1.) Language learning is a complex task that involves several essentialprocesses. For decades, these processes have been investigated throughobservations, surveys, and experiments in the attempt to give a concretedescription of the language learning phenomenon and assist the learners inachieving specific goals. (Griffiths, 2003; Oxford, 1990).2.) Learners with different levels of proficiency tend to choose varied strategiesbecause of their exposure to different learning materials and environment(Green &amp; Oxford, 1995).3.) Studies show that proficient learners mostly choose cognitive,metacognitive, and affective strategies (O'Malley &amp; Chamot, 1985).4.) Over the years, empirical studies along this line have been carried out. Forinstance, Ying-Chun Lai (2009) examined the language learning strategiesused by EFL learners in Taiwan in relation to language proficiency by utilizingthe students' results in The English Placement Test and the SILL survey.5.) Using a multi-method approach, Vidal (2002) revealed that metacognitivestrategies were commonly favored as opposed to memory and affectivestrategies​</h2><br />
