Describes the structure and composition of the Universe.3. States the different hypotheses that preceded the Big Bang Theory of the origin of the universe4. Explain the origin and evolution of theUniverse according to the Big Bang Theory.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.As long as the amount of stuff doesn't go over a critical threshold, the universe will continue to expand forever, and eventually suffer heat death, freezing out. But if there's too much stuff, the expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. Then the universe will begin to contract.</p><p>2.The large-scale structure of the Universe is made up of voids and filaments, that can be broken down into superclusters, clusters, galaxy groups, and subsequently into galaxies.</p><p>3.But the Big Bang is not the only proposed theory concerning our universe's origin. In the 1940s a competing hypothesis arose, called the Steady State theory. Some astronomers turned to this idea simply because, at the time, there wasn't enough information to test the Big Bang.</p><p>4.The best-supported theory of our universe's origin centers on an event known as the big bang. ... This theory was born of the observation that other galaxies are moving away from our own at great speed in all directions, as if they had all been propelled by an ancient explosive force</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The law of conservation of mass states that in a chemical reaction mass is neither created nor destroyed. For example, the carbon atom in coal becomes carbon dioxide when it is burned. The carbon atom changes from a solid structure to a gas but its mass does not change.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. toprock, downrock, power moves and freezes.</p><p>2.freezing from a fast movement and "locking" in a certain position, holding that position for a short while and then continuing at the same speed as before.</p><p>3. Boogaloo Sam was inspired to create a new style of dance after watching some dancers who were locking on television. He created Popping, which is a dance that combines rigid robotic moves with loose flowing moves. Popping came about in the 60's and started with Boogaloo Sam in Fresno California</p><p>4. Krumping is a style of street dance popularized in the United States, characterized by free, expressive, exaggerated, and highly energetic movement. Dancers who started krumping saw the dance as a means for them to escape gang life and "to express raw emotions in a powerful but non-violent way."</p><p>5. The people who do shuffle dance very good are called shufflers.</p><p>6. Shuffling originated in Melbourne, Australia, in the underground rave scene back in the early 1990s. It was here that the dance was deemed the name “The Melbourne Shuffle.” Since then it has taken off and become very popular in the mainstream EDM festival scene, practiced by millions of EDM fans all over the world.</p><p>7. Tutting is a style of dance that involves making shapes and angles (usually 90-degree angles) with the body, limbs, hands, fingers, etc,</p><p>8. Waacking is a dance style that was created in dance clubs on the west coast of the USA in the 1970s. Waacking is characterized by a focus on arm movements, creating shapes and poses above and around the head in a fast-moving style. Waacking is often danced to disco music.</p><br />

A geometry net is a 2-dimensional shape that can be folded to form a 3-dimensional shape or a solid. Or a net is a pattern made when the surface of a three-dimensional figure is laid out flat showing each face of the figure. Nets are helpful when we need to find the surface area of the solids.</p><p>e. Area = 4cm²</p><p>f. Factoring will help you find the dimensions of the new figure formed since factors are the dimensions of the new figure formed. Once the dimensions of the plane figure are identified, it will be easier to compute for the area and the volume.</p><p>g. What did you learn from this activity? I learned that geometric problem involving factoring of polynomials will allow us to solve other kinds of equations, which will, in turn, help us to solve a greater variety of word problems.</p><br />

                        Precipitation is the falling down of water droplets from the clouds due to the force of gravity.a. Use a glass of water when brushing teeth, b. inspect taps, c. inspect pipelines, d. add weights to the water tank in the toilet, e. close tap when it is not in use.Yes. This is because the water on Earth is not generated. It is just recycled by the environment in a process called <strong>water cycle.</strong>The water <strong>evaporates. </strong>The origin of energy that drives the water cycle is the <strong>sun.</strong> This is because the start of the water cycle is the process of evaporation. The change from liquid to gaseous state is called <strong>evaporation</strong>.The water from Earth travels to the atmosphere via <strong>evaporation</strong>, the water from the atmosphere then <strong>condenses</strong> to form clouds, which will later on fall as water droplets through <strong>precipitation</strong>.<p>For more information about water cycle, you may click the links below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/818901</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/92020</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/789160</p><p></p><p></p><br />
