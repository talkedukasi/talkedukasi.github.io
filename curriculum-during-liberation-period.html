                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the period of revolution in the Philippines, there were significant changes made to the educational system and curriculum. Here are some of the changes that were made:</p><p></p><p>1. Introduction of nationalistic curriculum - The curriculum during the revolution period shifted towards a more nationalistic approach, emphasizing the importance of Philippine culture and history. This was in response to the desire of Filipinos to break free from the oppressive colonial rule of Spain.</p><p></p><p>2. Establishment of schools and universities - During the revolution, many schools and universities were established in the Philippines, with the aim of educating Filipinos and providing them with the skills necessary to contribute to the growth and development of the country.</p><p></p><p>3. Integration of vocational training - The curriculum during the revolution period also included vocational training, aimed at providing Filipinos with the skills necessary to work in various industries and to become self-sufficient.</p><p></p><p>4. Use of the vernacular language - The use of the vernacular language, such as Tagalog, was promoted in the curriculum in order to make education more accessible to Filipinos who were not proficient in Spanish, which was the language of instruction during the Spanish colonial period.</p><p></p><p>5. Shift towards secular education - The curriculum during the revolution period also shifted towards secular education, with less emphasis on religious instruction and more focus on practical skills that could be applied in everyday life.</p><p></p><p>These changes in the curriculum during the period of revolution were aimed at empowering Filipinos and giving them the tools necessary to create a strong and independent nation. The focus on nationalistic and practical education helped to instill a sense of pride and self-reliance among Filipinos, which continues to influence the educational system in the Philippines today.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Liberalism in the 19th century
</strong></p><p><strong>As an ideology and in practice liberalism became the preeminent reform movement in Europe during the 19th century. Its fortunes, however, varied with the historical conditions in each country—the strength of the crown, the élan of the aristocracy, the pace of industrialization, and the circumstances of national unification. The national character of a liberal movement could even be affected by religion. Liberalism in Roman Catholic countries such as France, Italy, and Spain, for example, tended to acquire anticlerical overtones, and liberals in those countries tended to favour legislation restricting the civil authority and political power of the Catholic clergy.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In Great Britain the Whigs had evolved by the mid-19th century into the Liberal Party, whose reformist programs became the model for liberal political parties throughout Europe. Liberals propelled the long campaign that abolished Britain’s slave trade in 1807 and slavery itself throughout the British dominions in 1833. The liberal project of broadening the franchise in Britain bore fruit in the Reform Bills of 1832, 1867, and 1884–85. The sweeping reforms achieved by Liberal Party governments led by William Gladstone for 14 years between 1868 and 1894 marked the apex of British liberalism.</strong></p><br />

                            9. list down the reason why during this period liberation was hard to achieve the book thief​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are some reasons why liberation was hard to achieve during that period:</p><p></p><p>1. Nazi Regime: The book is set during the reign of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which had a tight grip on Germany and controlled every aspect of life, including freedom of expression and movement. The oppressive nature of the Nazi regime made it challenging for individuals or groups to openly resist or work towards liberation without facing severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>2. Fear and Intimidation: The Nazi regime employed brutal tactics to suppress dissent, including imprisonment, torture, and execution of those who opposed or resisted their rule. This atmosphere of fear and intimidation made it difficult for people to openly resist or work towards liberation, as they risked severe repercussions for themselves and their loved ones.</p><p></p><p>3. Surveillance and Informants: The Nazi regime employed a vast network of surveillance and informants, who reported on any signs of dissent or resistance. This made it challenging for individuals or groups to plan and coordinate liberation efforts without the risk of being exposed and swiftly dealt with by the authorities.</p><p></p><p>4. Lack of Resources: During the war, Germany was facing economic challenges, with shortages of food, fuel, and other essential resources. This made it difficult for any organized resistance movements to gather the necessary resources and support to mount a successful liberation effort.</p><p></p><p>5. Propaganda and Indoctrination: The Nazi regime used extensive propaganda and indoctrination to control the minds and beliefs of the German population. This made it challenging to mobilize widespread support for liberation efforts, as many people were influenced by the regime's ideologies and believed in their cause.</p><p></p><p>6. Military Superiority: The Nazi regime had a powerful military, which had a firm grip on Germany and occupied territories. This military superiority made it challenging for any resistance groups to challenge or overthrow the regime through conventional means, as they were outmatched in terms of resources and firepower.</p><p></p><p>7. Divided Loyalties: The book depicts how some characters had conflicting loyalties, torn between their personal beliefs and their loyalty to the Nazi regime. This internal struggle made it hard for them to openly support liberation efforts, as they feared repercussions from the regime or being seen as traitors by their peers.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> •The first settlement, at Sydney, consisted of about 850 convicts and their Marine guards and officers, led by Governor Arthur Phillip. They arrived at Botany Bay in the "First Fleet" of 9 transport ships accompanied by 2 small warships, in January, 1788.</p><p> •British settlement of Australia began as a penal colony governed by a captain of the Royal Navy. Until the 1850s, when local forces began to be recruited, British regular troops garrisoned the colonies with little local assistance.</p><p> </p><p><strong>B.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>•</strong>Australia became a nation on 1 January 1901, when the British Parliament passed legislation enabling the six Australian colonies to collectively govern in their own right as the Commonwealth of Australia.</p><p> • Australian manufacturing was supercharged in the 1800s by the enormous scientific, engineering, communications and transport advances occurring in Britain at the time on account of the Industrial Revolution. In the colony, human and animal power gave way in the early 1800s to wind power.</p><p></p><p><strong>C.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>•</strong><strong> </strong>Life was very hard for most of Australia's early settlers. The colonists of New South Wales struggled to find fertile land, and the hot, dry climate made farming even more difficult. The seasons were different from Britain's, and most of the plants and animals were unfamiliar.</p><p> •The colonies voted by referendum to unite in a federation in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought as part of British Empire and later Commonwealth in the two world wars and was to become a long-standing ally of the United States when threatened by Imperial Japan during World War II.</p><p></p><p><strong>D.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>•</strong>In the 1850s gold was discovered and the gold rush that followed brought people to Australia from all over the world. In 1901, Australia became a nation, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. One year later, Australia became one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote.</p><p> •Australia became a nation on 1 January 1901, when the British Parliament passed legislation enabling the six Australian colonies to collectively govern in their own right as the Commonwealth of Australia.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: The Japanese occupation of the Philippines (Filipino: Pananakop ng mga Hapones sa Pilipinas; Japanese: 日本のフィリピン占領; Hepburn: Nihon no Firipin Senryō) occurred between 1942 and 1945, when Imperial Japan occupied the Commonwealth of the Philippines during World War II.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As at Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000 km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until the surrender of Japan. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.[1]
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The landings on the island of Leyte were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of Leyte and Mindoro were cleared of Japanese soldiers. During the campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a suicidal defense of the islands. Cities such as Manila were reduced to rubble. Around 500,000 Filipinos died during the Japanese Occupation Period.[2]</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: tama na yan </strong></p><p></p><br />
