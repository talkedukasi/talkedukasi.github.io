In the Tagalog creation story, the main characters are the gods Bathala and Ulilang Kaluluwa.</p><p></p><p>Setting: The Maranao creation story is set in the region of Lanao, while the Tagalog creation story is set in the region of Luzon.</p><p></p><p>Creation Events: Both stories share some similar elements, such as the creation of the world and the elements that make it up, as well as the creation of the first humans. However, the details of these events vary greatly between the two stories.</p><p></p><p>Themes: Both stories share themes of creation, the origin of the world, and the beginnings of humanity. However, the Maranao creation story also emphasizes the importance of harmony and balance, while the Tagalog creation story emphasizes the role of sacrifice in the creation of the world.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while both the Maranao and Tagalog creation stories share some similarities in their themes and creation events, they differ in terms of their characters, settings, and details.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One may recall reading or having to perform a skit of the Panay-Visayan creation myth “Tungkung Langit and Alunsina” also known as “Alamat ng Ulan” as part of one’s required reading in high school or college. According to this myth, whenever it thunders or rains, it is Tungkung Langit, Pillar of the Sky, calling his beloved Alunsina back home after she ran away because of his wrath at her disobedience. Alunsina however is still yet to be found to this day. The creation of the world as we know it, it is said, was an attempt to make the world a better place for the lost.</p><p>There is a common misconception that modern people no longer create myths. However myths, in this sense, do not refer to falsehood, but a genre of narratives about the way the world works; what is true of experience rather than historical truths. Someone once described it as “tribal propaganda”, which raises the question, “So what if it’s propaganda?” Why do we tell stories?</p><p>Not only do myths shape the way one views the world, but “literature is the education of the human heart”, and it“always speaks to the immediate wound”(Cordero, 2017).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan lng po alm ko Sana nakatulong</p><br />

                        <p>In the beginning there were no people on the earth.</p><p>Lumawig, the Great Spirit, came down from the sky and cut many reeds. He divided these into pairs which he placed in different parts of the world, and then he said to them, "You must speak."</p><p>Immediately the reeds became people, and in each place was a man and a woman who could talk, but the language of each couple differed from that of the others.</p><p>Then Lumawig commanded each man and woman to marry, which they did. By and by there were many children, all speaking the same language as their parents. These, in turn, married and had many children. In this way there came to be many people on the earth.</p><p>Now Lumawig saw that there were several things which the people on the earth needed to use, so he set to work to supply them. He created salt, and told the inhabitants of one place to boil it down and sell it to their neighbors. But these people could not understand the directions of the Great Spirit, and the next time he visited them, they had not touched the salt.</p><p>Then he took it away from them and gave it to the people of a place called Mayinit. These did as he directed, and because of this he told them that they should always be owners of the salt, and that the other peoples must buy of them.</p><p>Then Lumawig went to the people of Bontoc and told them to get clay and make pots. They got the clay, but they did not understand the molding, and the jars were not well shaped. Because of their failure, Lumawig told them that they would always have to buy their jars, and he removed the pottery to Samoki. When he told the people there what to do, they did just as he said, and their jars were well shaped and beautiful. Then the Great Spirit saw that they were fit owners of the pottery, and he told them that they should always make many jars to sell.</p><p>In this way Lumawig taught the people and brought to them all the things which they now have.</p><br /><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Similarities:</p><p>Both tell that the deity created the world with words. The Jewish sages count ten instances in the opening Bible chapter where God speaks and an item came into being.</p><p></p><p>Differences:</p><p>In Genesis a single pair of humans was created from whom every individual and nation descended. Jewish sages emphasized that this teaches that all people are related. No one can say that he or she is a descendant of a superior ancestor. All humans share the spirit of God equally, no matter their religion or sex. This profound lesson is lost in the Egyptian Legend which maintains that the god created many humans simultaneously.</p><p></p><br />

                        In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth, and while the earth was still unformed, God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. Then God separated the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day and the darkness Night. And there was an evening and a morning, making the first day.<p>And God said, "Let there be a sky and let it divide the waters that are below from the waters that are above the sky." And it was done. And God called the sky the Heavens. And there was an evening and a morning, making the second day.</p><p>And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be brought together, and let the dry land appear." And it was done. And God called the dry land Earth and the waters that were brought together Seas. And God saw that it was good.</p><p>And God said, "Let plants and trees grow from the earth." And it was done. And plants and trees grew from the earth, each plant bringing forth its own kind of seed and each tree its own kind of fruit, and God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the third day.</p><p>And God said, "Let there be lights in the heavens to separate the night from the day. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years. Let them be lights in the heavens to light the earth." And it was done. So God made the two great lights (the sun and the moon): the greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night. God made the stars also and placed them in the heavens to throw light upon the earth. And God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the fourth day.</p><p>And God said, "Let the waters bring forth many living creatures and let birds fly above the earth and in the sky." And God made large sea-monsters and all kinds of living creatures with which the waters abound, and all kinds of birds. And God saw that it was good. And he blessed them, saying, "Increase and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." And there was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day.</p><p>And God said, "Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures, cattle and creeping things and wild beasts." And it was done. So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts, and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground. And God saw that it was good.</p><p>And God said, "Let us make man like ourselves. Let him rule over the fish in the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts and all the living things that crawl upon the ground." And God made man like himself, like God he made him. He made them male and female.</p><p>And God blessed them, and said to them, "Have children, increase, live all over the earth, and conquer it; rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that crawls upon the ground."</p><p>And God said, "See, to you I give every plant which grows on all the earth, and every tree which bears fruit with its own kind of seed. It shall be food for you. And to every wild beast and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that crawls on the earth and is alive, I give every green herb for food." And it was done.</p><p>And when God saw everything that he had made, he saw that it was very good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day.</p><p>And the heavens and the earth were finished and all that there was in them. And on the seventh day when God had finished the work which he had done, he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for in it he rested from all the work which he had done.</p><br />
