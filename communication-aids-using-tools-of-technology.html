However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</a>

However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</h2><br />
