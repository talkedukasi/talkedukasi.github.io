                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>How to Be an Effective Communicator in 7 Easy Steps<p></p><p>Effective communication is an essential skill for achieving success in all areas of life, whether personal or professional. Communication skills breed confidence and optimism, two character traits that enable you to accomplish your goals. Some people find that communication comes naturally; for others, it’s more difficult. But if you fall into the latter category, you don’t need a communication degree to make yourself heard—or to get what you want and need. The challenge of how to be an effective communicator gets far easier when you follow these seven steps:</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>Identify Your Objectives<p>What do you hope to accomplish, either immediately or long term? What action or response from your audience will show that you have communicated successfully? Understanding your objectives will help shape your communication style and make you more effective.</p><p></p>Listen Actively<p>Communication isn’t just about what you say. If you want people to listen to you, you need to listen to them. Don’t get so focused on what you’re saying that you miss their important comments, emotions, and reactions. Likewise, when others are speaking, listen and process what they’re trying to communicate instead of planning your response. When everyone is actively involved, communication is far more effective.</p><p></p>Note Your Body Language<p>Communication involves not just the words you speak, but what your body is saying. Without realizing it, your body language can send a stronger message than your words. If you sit or stand with your shoulders hunched and your arms folded across your chest, you show that your guard is up and you’re unwilling to have productive, two-way discussions. Alternatively, when you sit or stand up straight with your arms at your sides, or relax into a more casual pose, you project openness and a willingness to communicate—before you’ve said a single word.</p><p></p>Know Your Audience<p>The same speech, conversation, or sales pitch won’t succeed with every audience. Modify your language for each group so that you’re not being condescending or speaking in a way in which your audience can’t understand. Adjusting how and what you say to match your audience will improve your communication skills.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#BrainlyOnlineEducation</p><p>#LearnAtBrainly</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. advocacy is dealing with what your community needs to improve its health. You could also say that advocacy is the process of supporting people to solve health issues.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>2.</p><p>The 4Ms of operation in relations to business opportunity means that the four critical domains, usually attributed to manufacturing, those are: man, machine, material and method work together. These four critical domains are also applicable to business opportunities since business is in essence tied to manufacturing as well. When putting up a business, manpower is critical as well as the other elements. The businessman must take all of those into account. Let us look at each one refers to the system and step by step process in the business. Without a scalable process, it would be difficult to expand the business. This means that the methods used in the main branch must be documented and must be replicated as well in other branches. If it is difficult to implement at another site, find what needs to be improved.  </p><p> this is the worker. When setting up a business, finding honest and capable people is always a challenge. In my experience, people can be honest but may not be capable or competent and some are capable but not honest. It is a rare find to find someone with all the ideal qualities. So for a businessman, they must be able to treasure their employees who are both capable and honest as they are integral to the growth of the business</p><p></p><p> sourcing raw materials is critical in any business endeavor as the businessman would want to have the cheapest possible at the highest quality.  </p><p> machinery is also important. Without the proper equipment, you will not be able to perform the needed tasks efficiently. You may be able to use the manpower to do it but it is usually more efficient if machines are able to automate the work.</p><p></p><p>Running a business is a complex process and all of these elements interplay. It is not just one machine for example but many. Manpower issues could also arise, which would challenge the method that has been set up. It is up to the businessman to identify and solve these issues.</p><p></p><p>1.Community advocacy can make real change and understanding that change is important. Is it getting more people to take public transportation? Preventing childhood obesity? No matter the issue, knowing what you would like to see changed and being able to articulate it is half the battle. Many people just can’t say what the problem is and how they would fix it. Try to do that in ten words or less.</p><p></p><p>Don't Wait</p><p>Waiting for other people to do something about it is a bad idea. Waiting is detrimental to action. Think of the verbal and emotional barriers folks create around change. You will hear folks say things like:</p><p></p><p>“Oh, that is a good idea, but we don't have the money to do that.” Financial hurdles are big, but money is available if people really want change. Your job is to make that case.</p><p>“Someone else is already working on that.” Are they really working on it or is that an excuse? Don’t take someone else’s word for it, do some research for yourself.</p><p>“We have always done it this way.” Yes, and this is why we still have a problem. Be respectful, but make the case for why this needs to happen a different way.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Self-Advocacy</p><p></p><p>Self-advocacy refers to an individual's ability to effectively communicate, convey, negotiate or assert his or her own interests, desires, needs, and rights (VanReusen et al., 1994).</p><p>Self-advocacy means understanding your strengths and needs, identifying your personal goals, knowing your legal rights and responsibilities, and communicating these to others.</p><p>Self-Advocacy is speaking up for oneself!</p><p>Individual Advocacy</p><p></p><p>In individual advocacy a person or group of people concentrate their efforts on just one or two individuals. According to the group Advocacy for Inclusion "Advocacy is having someone to stand beside you if you think something is unfair or that someone is treating you badly and you would like to do something to change it."</p><p></p><p>There are two common forms of individual advocacy - informal and formal advocacy. When people like parents, friends, family members or agencies speak out and advocate for vulnerable people this is termed informal advocacy. Formal advocacy more frequently involves organizations that pay their staff to advocate for someone or for a group of individuals.</p><p></p><p>Systems Advocacy</p><p></p><p>Systems advocacy is about changing policies, laws or rules that impact how someone lives their life. These efforts can be targeted at a local, state, or national agency. The focus can be changing laws, or simply written or unwritten policy. What is targeted depends on the type of problem and who has authority over the problem (Brain Injury Resource Center, 1998).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELP｡^‿^｡</p><br />
