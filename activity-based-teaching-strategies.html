                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

A few researches in the linguistic fields have developed training programs designed to improve native speakers ability to understand accente speech (Derwing, Rossiter, Munro; Krech Thomas, 2004). Their training techniques are based on the research described above. Indicating that comprehension improves with exposure to nonnative speech. Derwing; et al. (2002) conducted their training with students preparing to be social workers, but note that other professionals who work with nonnative speakers could benefit from a similar program. References: 1.

ANSWER:2. Plan instruction Teacher Gina thought it is best to apply a constructivist approach to help her student learn techniques in multiplying whole numbers. She planned a lesson that incorporates the problem- solving strategy. ANSWER:3. implement plan The class went on smoothly. The activities that teacher gina prepared were successfully done by student. ANSWER:4. Check for understanding To make sure that her students understood the lesson, teacher gina gave a three-item exercise as an exit pass. ANSWER:5. reflect on teaching Based on the exit pass, teacher gina found out that many of the students have difficulty multiplying numbers that involve the digit 8. So , she decided tp do a find-your-error activity the next day for the students to realize their mistakes. She also planned to give a short drill on skip counting by 8 ANSWER:6. Assess learning and reflect on result Teacher gina ,later on, gave a multiplication quiz. Ninety percent of the students passed. She planned to give remedial exercises to those who failed. This teaching cycle taught teacher gina that the students can discover concepts on their own. However ,they must still be guided by a teacher because misconceptions may arise.ANSWER:ASSESS Answer the following questions to verbalize your acquired concepts about the teaching cycle. 1.

                            5. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />

                            7. Experience The following is a narrative of how a teacher might experience the teaching cycle. 1. identify objectives Teacher Gina identified “ multiplication of the whole numbers up to two digits” as the goal of ther next lesson. ANSWER:2. Plan instruction Teacher Gina thought it is best to apply a constructivist approach to help her student learn techniques in multiplying whole numbers. She planned a lesson that incorporates the problem- solving strategy. ANSWER:3. implement plan The class went on smoothly. The activities that teacher gina prepared were successfully done by student. ANSWER:4. Check for understanding To make sure that her students understood the lesson, teacher gina gave a three-item exercise as an exit pass. ANSWER:5. reflect on teaching Based on the exit pass, teacher gina found out that many of the students have difficulty multiplying numbers that involve the digit 8. So , she decided tp do a find-your-error activity the next day for the students to realize their mistakes. She also planned to give a short drill on skip counting by 8 ANSWER:6. Assess learning and reflect on result Teacher gina ,later on, gave a multiplication quiz. Ninety percent of the students passed. She planned to give remedial exercises to those who failed. This teaching cycle taught teacher gina that the students can discover concepts on their own. However ,they must still be guided by a teacher because misconceptions may arise.ANSWER:ASSESS Answer the following questions to verbalize your acquired concepts about the teaching cycle. 1.	In what stage/s of the teaching cycle are the students involved? Explain  ANSWER: 2.	How is the diagram you created in #1 similar or different from the cycle that was presented in this lesson?  ANSWER:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Experience:<br />Overall, this teaching cycle shows the importance of planning and reflection in effective teaching. By identifying clear objectives and planning instruction that aligns with those objectives, teacher Gina was able to create a lesson that successfully engaged her students and helped them learn multiplication techniques. Checking for understanding through an exit pass allowed her to assess her students' comprehension and make adjustments to her teaching plan if necessary. Reflecting on the lesson and using assessment data to guide future instruction allowed teacher Gina to continually improve her teaching and support her students' learning.<br /></p><p>ASSES:<br />1. The students are involved in all stages of the teaching cycle. In the first stage, they are the focus of the lesson objectives. In the second stage, the teacher plans instruction with the students' needs and abilities in mind. In the third stage, the students are actively participating in the lesson. In the fourth stage, the teacher checks for understanding by assessing the students' comprehension of the lesson. In the fifth stage, the teacher reflects on the lesson and decides how to adjust instruction to help the students who did not fully understand the lesson. In the sixth stage, the students are assessed on their learning and the teacher reflects on the results to adjust instruction and improve student learning.</p><p></p><p>2. The diagram I created in question #1 is similar to the teaching cycle presented in this lesson, as it includes the same stages of identifying objectives, planning instruction, implementing the plan, checking for understanding, reflecting on teaching, and assessing learning. However, my diagram did not include the specific details and actions taken by the teacher in each stage, as presented in the narrative.</p><br />
