                                            What's In Hello! The lesson that we are going to tackle in this module is about reading observing the skill of skimming to determine key ideas an author's purpose. Before that, let us recall our previous knowledge about what skimming is. Skimming is a strategic, selective reading method in which you focus on the main ideas of a text When skimming, deliberately skip text that provides details, stories, data, or other elaboration. Instead of closely reading every word, focus on the introduction, chapter summaries, first and last sentences of paragraphs, bold words, and text features. Skimming is extracting the essence of the author's main messages rather than the finer points, What I Need to Know At the end of this module, you should be able to 1. Define what skimming is. 2. Appreciate the function of skimming, 3. Use skimming skill in a given text to get the main idea from the author.​</a>

                                            SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</a>

                            3. What's In Hello! The lesson that we are going to tackle in this module is about reading observing the skill of skimming to determine key ideas an author's purpose. Before that, let us recall our previous knowledge about what skimming is. Skimming is a strategic, selective reading method in which you focus on the main ideas of a text When skimming, deliberately skip text that provides details, stories, data, or other elaboration. Instead of closely reading every word, focus on the introduction, chapter summaries, first and last sentences of paragraphs, bold words, and text features. Skimming is extracting the essence of the author's main messages rather than the finer points, What I Need to Know At the end of this module, you should be able to 1. Define what skimming is. 2. Appreciate the function of skimming, 3. Use skimming skill in a given text to get the main idea from the author.​</h2><br />

                            7. SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
