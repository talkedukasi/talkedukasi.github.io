Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.
2
What means that noise, that bustle we hear?
Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.
3
There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!
8
My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3.

The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5.

Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture of Asia encompasses the collective and diverse customs and traditions of art, architecture, music, literature, lifestyle, philosophy, politics and religion that have been practiced and maintained by the numerous ethnic groups of the continent of Asia since prehistory. Identification of a specific culture of Asia or universal elements among the colossal diversity that has emanated from multiple cultural spheres and three of the four ancient River valley civilizations is complicated. However, the continent is commonly divided into six geographic sub-regions, that are characterized by perceivable commonalities, like culture, religion, language and relative ethnic (racial) homogeneity. These regions are Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia.[1]</p><p></p><p>Asia (orthographic projection).svg</p><p>As the largest, most populous continent and rich in resources, Asia is home to several of the world's oldest civilizations, that produced the majority of the great religious systems, the oldest known recorded myths and codices on ethics and morality.[2][3]</p><p></p><p>However, Asia's enormous size separates the various civilizations by great distances and hostile environments, such as deserts and mountain ranges. Yet by challenging and overcoming these distances, trade and commerce gradually developed a truly universal, Pan-Asian character. Inter-regional trade was the driving and cohesive force, by which cultural elements and ideas spread to the various sub-regions via the vast road network and the many sea routes.[4]</p><p></p><p>Multiple cultural regions	</p><p>Architecture	</p><p>Art	</p><p>Languages	</p><p>Literature	</p><p>Family	</p><p>Philosophy	</p><p>Religions</p><br />

                        Padre Faura Witnesses the Execution of Rizal<p>Poem that has become a written witness of Rizal's death. It was written by  Danton Remoto. A free - verse poem relaying what had happened on the 30th of December, 1896. It uses some words which are appealing to the heart. It conveys the message of looking back and paying respect to our national hero.</p><p></p>Answers:Padre Faura - a priest and the director of the Manila Observatory. He was also Jose Rizal’s favorite mentor ; Pepe - a name given to Jose Rizal when he was young; Soldiers - those that have executed Jose Rizal.Padre Faura is the one who is speaking in the poem. One sentence that will prove that it was him is the first line of the poem which says "I stand on the roof of the Ateneo municipal, shivering on this December morning."The poem "Padre Faura Witnesses the Execution of Rizal" is a type of a free -verse poem since it does not use consistent meter, pattern and rhyme. Free verse poems are popular styles of contemporary poetry.Padre Faura was witnessing the execution of Rizal which is incomparable to a situation on purgatory.Our country as described on the poem is compared to purgatory. Purgatory is the condition, process, or place of purification or temporary punishment in which, according to medieval Christian and Roman Catholic belief, the souls of those who die in a state of grace are made ready for heaven.I believed the poem is addressed to all the Filipino people. Inasmuch as Padre Faura wanted to instill on our minds the legacy of Rizal especially on how he love and treasure education which according to him will save the country from poverty and imperialism.I felt helpless and regretful for not being able to help my student if I were on his shoes.The author felt hurting and regretful.Danton Remoto wanted to convey the message of looking back and remembering the stars that shines but are now dead. They are commonly known as heroes.<p></p><p>What is the message of the poem "Padre Faura Witnesses the Execution of Rizal": <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/771888</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />

Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!
8
My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

                            29. true or false 1. During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3. Oral and written literatures were not present in the Filipino culture before the colonizers came. 4. The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5. The separate, yet parallel developments of Philippine literature in English and those in Tagalog and other languages of the archipelago during the American period only proved that literature and writing in whatever language and in whatever climate were able to survive mainly through the active imagination of writers. 6. Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13. Imagery in poetry pertains to mental pictures. 14. Literature developed alongside Philippine history is a valid observation of literary development in the Philippines. 15. The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</h2><br />
