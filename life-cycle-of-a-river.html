                                            DISTURBACES IN ESTUARIES          Estuaries are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where rivers meet the sea.They are homes to unique plants and animals that have adapted to brackish water-mixture fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater. Numerous marine species use the nutrient – rich and sheltered estuaries as nurserygrounds.          Some fish species not only migrate between the waters of the various oceans and seas, but also require migrating between freshwaters and the marine waters. Such fishes, which spend part of their life-cycle in salt-water and a part in freshwater, are called diadromous fishes, e.g. the eel fish, the salmon, and the trout. These include the anadromousspecies which migrate from the sea to freshwater for spawning (process oflaying eggs), and the catadromous species, which spawn in the ocean or at sea, and migrate towards freshwater as juveniles. The regions in many coastal areas are highly disturbed today due to constant disturbance from the mainland in the form of pollution—pesticidal pollution, discharge from sewage system, silt, and etc. Such disturbances in the estuarine and coastal areas make migration of diadromous fishes to their spawning areas difficult, and adversely affect their populations by acting as the major blockage in the lifecycle of these species.A. Guide Questions:1. What biotic components can be found in estuaries?2. Name the role in ecosystem of the biotic components found in estuaries.3. What characteristics of the abiotic factor in estuaries make it suitable for spawning?4. What are the abiotic factor disturbances mentioned in the paragraph?5. How do the abiotic factors affect in the life cycle of fish species?​</a>

Respiration, and decomposition are three other ways that CO₂ and/or oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. The water cycle, also known as the describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. When solar energy warms the Earth's surface, water from the oceans, rivers, lakes and land. Organisms use and produce gases in photosynthesis and During respiration, plants use and produce carbon dioxide. Cellular respiration is the process by which animals take in sugars and oxygen and emit water and energy. and other vital In nitrogen assimilation, plants finally consume the nitrates made by soil bacteria and use them to make nucleotides, hemicals for life. The nitrogen cycle refers to the cycle of atoms through the living and non-living systems of Earth. Ammonia may be converted back into atmospheric nitrogen through the process​</a>

When solar energy warms the Earth's surface, water oceans, rivers, lakes and land. 4. Organisms use and produce gases in photosynthesis and 5. During respiration, plants use and produce carbon dioxide. 6. Cellular respiration is the process by which animals take in sugars and oxygen and emit water and energy. 7. In nitrogen assimilation, plants finally consume the nitrates made by soil bacteria and use them to make nucleotides, and other vital chemicals for life. 8.

                            4. DISTURBACES IN ESTUARIES          Estuaries are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where rivers meet the sea.They are homes to unique plants and animals that have adapted to brackish water-mixture fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater. Numerous marine species use the nutrient – rich and sheltered estuaries as nurserygrounds.          Some fish species not only migrate between the waters of the various oceans and seas, but also require migrating between freshwaters and the marine waters. Such fishes, which spend part of their life-cycle in salt-water and a part in freshwater, are called diadromous fishes, e.g. the eel fish, the salmon, and the trout. These include the anadromousspecies which migrate from the sea to freshwater for spawning (process oflaying eggs), and the catadromous species, which spawn in the ocean or at sea, and migrate towards freshwater as juveniles. The regions in many coastal areas are highly disturbed today due to constant disturbance from the mainland in the form of pollution—pesticidal pollution, discharge from sewage system, silt, and etc. Such disturbances in the estuarine and coastal areas make migration of diadromous fishes to their spawning areas difficult, and adversely affect their populations by acting as the major blockage in the lifecycle of these species.A. Guide Questions:1. What biotic components can be found in estuaries?2. Name the role in ecosystem of the biotic components found in estuaries.3. What characteristics of the abiotic factor in estuaries make it suitable for spawning?4. What are the abiotic factor disturbances mentioned in the paragraph?5.

The water cycle, also known as the describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. When solar energy warms the Earth's surface, water from the oceans, rivers, lakes and land. Organisms use and produce gases in photosynthesis and During respiration, plants use and produce carbon dioxide. Cellular respiration is the process by which animals take in sugars and oxygen and emit water and energy. and other vital In nitrogen assimilation, plants finally consume the nitrates made by soil bacteria and use them to make nucleotides, hemicals for life.

It even flows through the soil and becomes ground water.</p><p></p>Definition:<p></p><p>The <strong>water</strong> <strong>cycle </strong>is also known as the hydrological cycle, this is how the earth's water recycles itself. The cycle includes precipitation, evaporation, condensation, and transpiration. Earth's water keeps changing from liquid water to vapour and then back again. This cycle happens because of the sun's heat and gravity. </p><p></p><p>Read More: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9435624</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>// #CarryOnLearning</p><br />
