Compare and contrast our time to the 70s and 80s in terms of the following:  <p>a. What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in a post- industrial/technological society?  </p><p>Advantages:</p><p></p><p>Post-industrial societies focus on theoretical knowledge, creating new scientific disciplines and technological advances. Some of the effects of post-industrialization are outsourcing manufacturing jobs to other countries, working from home, global communities, and global networking</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Disadvantages: disparities between social classes becomes wider.  </strong></p>b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in BEFORE post-industrial/technological society?  <p>Advantages: privacy is not sacrificed, less costs</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages: limited jobs</p><p></p><p></p>c. What are the differences of social relationships between those living 70s 80s and to our contemporary era?  <p>In the 70s and 80s, if you wanted to socialize, you had to make the effort to leave the comfort and security of your home and drive to a place where you would be likely to see other people of about your own age. Depending on who you were and what your goals were, that might mean spending a considerable amount of time on your appearance. The idea was to impress people.</p><p></p><p></p>d. Concept of love and friendship  <p>Love and friendship are strict boundaries that doesn’t usually encompass each other.
