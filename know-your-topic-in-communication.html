Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</a>

                            11. True or False
The need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators.
Virtual interactions have always been an important factor of success in business.
In a globalized world, effective communication is a necessity.
The first step in achieving effective communication is to know your location.
Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</h2><br />
