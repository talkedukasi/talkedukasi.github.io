Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal means 2. Society cannot function without communication, whether it is face-to-face conversation across a dinner table or video conferencing across international boundaries 3. Communication is said to be "the creation and exchange of meaning." 4. Communication is an intricate process of sharing ideas, thoughts, and information True 5. The earliest model of communication was developed by Aristotle. True 6. Communication is stirring up ideas in the mind of another, sharing of ideas among group of people. 7. Aristotle was a teacher of rhetoric and even put up an academy to produce good speakers 8. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver model gave us the concept of noise 9. William Schramm is the Father of Mass Communication 10. Schramm asserts that communication can take place if and only if there is overlap between the Field of Experience of the Speaker and the Field of Experience of the Listener 11. Eugene White contributed the concept of Feedback to the field of communication 12. Channels are the means by which the message is sent. 13. Shannon and Weaver assert that the Message sent by the Source (Speaker) is not necessarily the Message received by the Destination (listener) 14. Feedback is the perception by the speaker about the response of the listener 15. Listener is the one who receives the message 16. Message is what needs to be delivered or imparted to somebody else 17. The response is the only way the speaker knows that the Message has been received 18. There are only five channels: ears, eyes, skin, mouth and nose. 19. A listener may respond to the Message positively or negatively, 20. The listener is the one who makes sense of what is said and reacts to it by clapping, nodding the head, replying, asking a return question, following the speaker, falling asleep or walking out 21. Miscommunication is brought about by the lack of awareness of the dimensions of communication especially those influenced by culture and gender. 22. Noise is considered as a barrier in communication.​</a>

The most important part of this model is Setting. 3. This model had only three elements of communication. 4. It is considered to be the Father of Mass Communication. 5. The field of experience had been emphasized by this model. 6. Setting dictates the Message in this model. 7. It gives the concept of "Noise" as a barrier to communication. 8. It explains why communication breakdown occurs. 9. It is a two-way process. 10. This model is interactive and collaborative,​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Models of communication are conceptual models used to explain the human communication process. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by Claude Shannon and published with an introduction by Warren Weaver for Bell Laboratories.[1] Following the basic concept, communication is the process of sending and receiving messages or transferring information from one part (sender) to another (receiver).[2]</p><br />

Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal means 2. Society cannot function without communication, whether it is face-to-face conversation across a dinner table or video conferencing across international boundaries 3. Communication is said to be "the creation and exchange of meaning." 4. Communication is an intricate process of sharing ideas, thoughts, and information True 5. The earliest model of communication was developed by Aristotle. True 6. Communication is stirring up ideas in the mind of another, sharing of ideas among group of people. 7. Aristotle was a teacher of rhetoric and even put up an academy to produce good speakers 8. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver model gave us the concept of noise 9. William Schramm is the Father of Mass Communication 10. Schramm asserts that communication can take place if and only if there is overlap between the Field of Experience of the Speaker and the Field of Experience of the Listener 11. Eugene White contributed the concept of Feedback to the field of communication 12. Channels are the means by which the message is sent. 13. Shannon and Weaver assert that the Message sent by the Source (Speaker) is not necessarily the Message received by the Destination (listener) 14. Feedback is the perception by the speaker about the response of the listener 15. Listener is the one who receives the message 16. Message is what needs to be delivered or imparted to somebody else 17. The response is the only way the speaker knows that the Message has been received 18. There are only five channels: ears, eyes, skin, mouth and nose. 19. A listener may respond to the Message positively or negatively, 20. The listener is the one who makes sense of what is said and reacts to it by clapping, nodding the head, replying, asking a return question, following the speaker, falling asleep or walking out 21. Miscommunication is brought about by the lack of awareness of the dimensions of communication especially those influenced by culture and gender. 22. Noise is considered as a barrier in communication.​</h2><br />

Explain what should be common to the experience of the speaker and the experience of the listener to achieve a better understanding.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In Schramm model of communication, the field of experience of the speaker should overlap the field of experience of the listener to have a better communication. Explain what should be common to the experience of the speaker and the experience of the listener to achieve a better understanding.Fields of experience can be defined as, “life experiences, attitudes, values, and beliefs that each communicator brings to an interaction and that shape how messages are sent and received” Wilbur L. Schramm was a forefather in the development of a basic model of communication.cyclical communication</p><p>What is the Schramm Communication Model? The Schramm Communication Model is a cyclical communication model containing all basic principles of communication. The Schramm Communication Model offers a classic approach to and explanation of communication.Wilbur Schramm is considered the FATHER OF MASS COMMUNICATION. In this model he asserts that communication can take place if and only if there is an overlap between the Field of Experience of the Speaker and the listener. ... This is the first and earliest (5BC) model of communication.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is just idea</p><br />

                        Based on Schramm's Model 1 of year 1954, the sender and the receiver's common field of experience clearly emphasizes that aside from they both pass through the signal, it was also shown there the process wherein when the sender encodes; the receiver will decode -which only means that what happens on the sender's field will also happen at the receiver's field. If the sender encoded a message, the receiver will decode it then, so a feedback will be given after.<br />
