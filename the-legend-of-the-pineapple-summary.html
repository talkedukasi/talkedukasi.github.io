                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pineapple is the common name for a little fruit thing and its edible, which is actually a consisting of coalesced berries. It was given the name pineapple due to its resemblance to a pine cone. The pineapple is by far the most economically important plant in the grocery store. Besides being produced for consumption, it can be grown as an ornamental or houseplant, obtained from the crown of a supermarket fruit. Some sources say that the plant will flower after about 24 months and produce a fruit during the following six months, while others indicate a 20-month timetable.[4]Pineapple can be consumed fresh, canned or juiced and can be used in a variety of ways. It is popularly used in hummus, salads (usually tropical fruit salads, but it can vary), jams, yogurts, ice creams, various candies, as a complement to meat dishes and in yogurt. The popularity of the pineapple is due to its sweet-sour taste. The core of the pineapple is continuous with the stem supporting the fruit and with the crown, a feature unique among cultivated fruits.Pineapple is used for many other things aside from consumption. In the Philippines, pineapple leaves are used as the source of a textile fiber called peenut. This fiber can used in a variety of ways such as a wall paper and a component of furnishings. Pineapple can also be used as a weapon in some cultures. Pineapple is commonly eaten as a food or as a condiment on dishes such as plates of food to eat it. It is commonly used as for eating it too by itself as well as not that way. It is most commonly consumed through the mouth although also by chewing and eating.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>House and garden◉‿◉(•‿•)(•‿•)(•‿•)</p><br />

They were poor, and the mother worked day and night to make both ends meet. No matter how hard she worked, though, she never got any help from her daughter. Pina was a lazy, spoiled kid who liked to play in the backyard all day. Whenever her mother asked for help around the house or tried to send her on an errand, she would always find an excuse by saying she can’t find the object that was needed to complete that task. If her mother asked her to sweep the house, for example, she would say she cannot find the broom, even if it was right there in front of her. Needless to say, her mother always ended up doing the work herself.</p><p></p><p>      One day, her mother became very ill. She called out to Pina, who as usual was playing in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>      “Pina! Pina! Come over here, anak. I am very sick. Can you cook some porridge for me please? I am too weak to get up.”</p><p></p><p>      Pina ignored her mother and continued to play.</p><p></p><p>      “Pina, come over here this very instant, or else!” Pina’s mother mustered all her strength just to say this, but it worked. Pina grudgingly stopped playing and went inside the house. She poked her head inside her mother’s room.</p><p></p><p>      “What do you want, Nanay (mother)? You really expect me to cook for you? That’s too hard,” protested Pina, pouting and stomping her feet.</p><p></p><p>      “Pina, it is very simple. Just put some rice in a pot and add water. Once the water boils, let it simmer for awhile. Stir it occasionally with a ladle. Everything you need should be right there in the kitchen.”</p><p></p><p>      Pina reluctantly left and went to the kitchen. Her mother could hear her banging the drawers and cabinets. Then her mother heard her open the back door and sneak out into the backyard. Her mother waited and waited. Finally, she called out to Pina again.</p><p></p><p>      “Pina, did you cook like I told you to?”</p><p></p><p>      “No,” was the defiant response.</p><p></p><p>      “And why not?” was her mom’s exasperated response.</p><p></p><p>      “Because I could not find the ladle,” was her flippant reply.</p><p></p><p>      “Oh, you lazy child! You probably did not even bother to look for it! What am I going to do with you?  Here I am, sick, and I cannot even count on you!” </p><p></p><p>      Her mother wept bitterly. In her anger, she shouted, “I wish you would grow a thousand eyes all over your head! Then you can find what you’re looking for. Maybe then you won’t have any more excuses.” </p><p></p><p>      As soon as she said this, there was complete silence. Her mother thought, “She is trying to be quiet so I will forget about asking her again.” She sighed.</p><p></p><p>      She waited a little bit to see if Pina would come back. Realizing the wait was futile, she wearily got up to do the cooking herself. When she looked out into the backyard, Pina was nowhere to be found. She sighed again and said to herself,  “That lazy kid probably went to a friend’s house so she did not have to do any more errands for me.”</p><p></p><p>      Exhausted from the exertion, she soon went back to her room for a much-needed rest. Weak as she was, she just tried to do everything by herself, having given up on any help from Pina. Hours passed by, and then days. Still no sign of her wayward daughter. With a heavy heart, she thought that Pina had ran away for sure. </p><p></p><p>      When she finally recovered from her illness, the first thing she did was look for Pina. No one had seen or heard from her. It was like she disappeared into thin air. Months passed and still no sign of her. The mother felt bad for her angry outburst, and she feared that she might probably never see her daughter again.</p><p></p><p>       One day, she was sweeping the backyard where Pina used to play. For months now, she had noticed this strange plant growing on the very spot where she last saw Pina. By this time, the leaves of the plant had fully opened. Inside, she saw this strange yellow fruit that resembled a child’s head with a thousand eyes. A thousand eyes…</p><p></p><p>      She suddenly remembered the spiteful words she used that fateful day. With horror, she realized that in the same way her mother’s love had spoiled her daughter, so did her anger  unwittingly curse her.  Somehow, her daughter had been turned into this plant.</p><p></p><p>      To honor the memory of her beloved daughter, she named the fruit Pina. She took such loving care of it like it was her own daughter. The fruit flourished so well that it bore more and more fruits, and became popular among the village and the entire country. Its name later evolved to pinya, or pineapple in English. That’s how the pineapple came to be, according to folklore, named after a spoiled child who was cursed with a thousand eyes…</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. Legend of the pineapple bibliography</h2><br />
                        There was a pretty little girl called Pina who was pampered by her mother as an only child. Everything that Pina asked for, Pina got. Everything that Pina scoffed at was taken away. No one in her village was ever so spoiled as Pina. No one was ever such a snobbish child. She was so lazy, and she had never stirred a finger to work in her life.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />Pina’s mother was perfectly happy that way, for Pina remained dependent on her as a spoiled child. But one day, Pina’s mother fell ill and there was no one to take care of Pina. She resolved that she would get well immediately for Pina’s sake – but she knew she would need help.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Pina, Pina," she called weakly, from her cot. "Come here a moment. I have something to ask of you."<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />Pina had never been asked to do anything in her life, and she was quite prepared to refuse, but she said anyway, "What is it, Mother?"<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Pina," said the doting mother, "I am too sick to make you anything to eat. I am too sick to eat anything solid. I need you to cook lugaw for me, Pina. It is very easy: just put some rice in a pot, pour some water in with it, add a pinch of sugar, and leave the mixture to boil for a while."<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Oh, that’s too hard! I won’t do it," Pina said firmly.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"You have to, Pina!" her mother pleaded. "What will your poor Nanay eat?"<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />But Pina was immovable. At length her mother resorted to shouting if only to catch her attention. Moping, Pina dragged her heavy feet down the stairs to gather the things she needed to make lugaw. She managed to find the rice, the water, the bowl, the sugar – but she could not find the ladle anywhere. How was she supposed to cook lugaw without a ladle?<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Nanay, where is the ladle?" Pina shouted.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"It is beside the other kitchen utensils, Pina, you know where I keep them," her mother weakly shouted back.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />But the ladle was not anywhere near the other kitchen utensils, and Pina was too lazy to look for it elsewhere. "I can’t find the ladle, mother," she complained. "I guess I won’t be cooking without the ladle."<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Oh, you lazy child," Pina’s mother wept. "You won’t even look! I hope you grow a thousand eyes so you’ll be able to find it!" After saying these words, Pina’s mother noticed that the house had fallen silent. Pina was no longer griping downstairs! That was a marvel. Perhaps she was already cooking. Pina’s mother would be happy if the child would cook her anything, even if it were burnt.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />But a long time had passed, and still the house was silent, and still Pina’s mother could not smell the cooking coals burning. She began to get worried. With all her meager strength she called out for Pina. Pina did not come, but the neighbors heard her pitiful cries, and they decided to drop by to see what was wrong. They took care of Pina’s mother in the child’s place.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Where is Pina?" Pina’s mother asked at once. "Where is my child?"<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"Oh, you know that girl," they assured her, "she must be in some friend’s house, having a good time. She hates responsibility. She may only be a little angry at you because you had asked her to work. It will pass, and she will come home."<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />Pina’s mother rested easily with that thought, and she recovered quickly. But she was up and about and asking all around town for her precious little child, and still Pina had not returned.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />One sunny day, while Pina’s mother was cleaning their back yard, she saw a strange yellow fruit about as large as the head of a child that had sprung up from the ground. "How curious!" she thought, and bent to examine it. The strange, spiny yellow fruit, she saw, had a thousand black eyes.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />"A thousand eyes...!" she gasped, remembering a mother’s curse carelessly let out. "My Pina!"<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />But there was nothing to be done. Imagine a thousand black eyes and not one of them seeing, and not one of them being able to shed a tear. Pina’s mother, who still loved the child more than anything in the world, decided to honor her memory by taking the seeds of the strange yellow fruit and planting them. When after a while there was more of the fruit, Pina’s mother gave her harvest away to everyone she knew. Thus Pina, in another form, became generous to others.<br /><br />￼￼￼<br />￼￼￼<br /><br />To this day the Filipinos call the yellow fruit pinya, after the pretty spoiled child.<br /><br /><br />
