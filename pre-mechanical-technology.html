                            1. Give three major technological development in the pre-mechanical age that created a large impact on your daily life then explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The earliest age of information technology is during the pre-mechanical age. In the pre-mechanical age, technology has always been around already. The only difference is that these technologies were already highly developed today. The major technological development in the pre-mechanical age include: simple picture drawings known as petroglyths, numbering systems, and creation and development of paper out of papyrus plant.</p><p>Because of  petroglyths, early alphabets were developed such as the Phoenician alphabet. The pens and papers also began to be developed as the alphabets became more popular and more people started learning on writing down information. With these developments, we can properly communicate and have better understanding of the messages being communicated through writing. The first books and libraries were also developed due to the need for permanent storage of the writings and information.</p><p>The people from India first created the 1-9 numbering system. Hundreds of years later, the number 0 was invented. Many people wanted to do lots of things using the created numbers and so it gave birth to calculators.  The very first sign of an information processor is a calculator. The abacus was the most popular model during the pre-mechanical age. The use of calculator makes thins very convenient especially in solving complex mathematical problems or in businesses.</p><p></p><p>#brainlyfast</p><p></p><p></p><br />
