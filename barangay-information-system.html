                                            Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</a>

                                            Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor. (name) on how they prepare if there the province of Bulacan hit by a natural disaster. Good afternoon, Mayor. (NAME!!), we’re here to ask you some question on (1) How you and your local government do to prepare for natural disaster occurs in the province of Malolos, Bulacan. (2) Are your local governments ready to provide assistance after disaster?(3) Is there any activities in your community after the disaster? If there's any, what are those? (4) As a local government official what can you do to help?Conclusion.Outro.​</a>

Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</h2><br />

                            22. Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor. (name) on how they prepare if there the province of Bulacan hit by a natural disaster. Good afternoon, Mayor. (NAME!!), we’re here to ask you some question on (1) How you and your local government do to prepare for natural disaster occurs in the province of Malolos, Bulacan. (2) Are your local governments ready to provide assistance after disaster?(3) Is there any activities in your community after the disaster? If there's any, what are those? (4) As a local government official what can you do to help?Conclusion.Outro.​</h2><br />
