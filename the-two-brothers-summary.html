                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

                                            Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1. How would you describe Willy as a father?2. What can you tell about the relationship of the family to each other?3. What led Willy to commit suicide? Is there a way that this could have been avoided? ​</a>

Elias had two weeks until the due date. # Elias could have gone home and started the project. Instead, he put it off. He went skateboarding with his friends at the park, and he played video games with his brother. When his mom suggested he clean his room, Elias happily cleaned. He chose to do anything other than the project. Elias suddenly panicked as he remembered the due date. The project was due tomorrow! He hadn't even started. He was too afraid to tell his mom. She would not be happy about this. Immediately, Elias began scrambling to figure out how he could get the project done on time. At school the next day, Elias turned in his finished product. Elias was not proud of the work he had completed. He believed it would have been much better if he spent more time on it. Elias wished that he had been more responsible.​</a>

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</a>

                        <p>Two Brothers is the story of gorgeously shot majestic creatures in a tale that is softly told and truly touching. It begins as two tigers meet in the Southeast Asian jungle and are attracted to each other. We soon get twins, <strong>shy Sangha and bold Kumal</strong>. Sangha is taken to safety by the mother tiger, but Kumal is left behind. The bold brother is sold off to a circus, where homesickness and living in a cage rob him of his spirit.The timid cub is the cherished accompaniment to the lonely young son of the governor, before an accident causes the family to give him to a man who wants to destroy his gentle disposition and turn him into a sport fighter. The brothers find themselves reunited when they are fully grown  but as forced rivals pitted one against the other.</p><p></p><p>For More information</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/996903</p><p>#BetterWithBrainly</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            2. two brothers summary</h2><br />
                        1920s Indochina. In the wild, a pair of adult tigers have just had a litter of two male cubs. It is a loving family unit, with the two brothers having a bond through their adventurous spirit. In different incidents, the cubs are captured individually, and although both in captivity live very different lives. Their individual captures were directly or indirectly associated with the work of Aidan McRory, a treasure and big game hunter, whose main goal is to make as much money for himself by selling his largely illegally obtained artifacts and animal parts at auction in Europe. Through the process, he has an emotional connection with one of the cubs, who is eventually named Kumal, but of who he eventually loses track. The cubs' lives are affected negatively by a number of other people who are working solely toward their own end goals, but the other cub, who is eventually named Sangha, also makes an emotional human connection to a young boy named Raoul Normandin, the son of the area administrator. Similar to Kumal and Aidan, Raoul eventually loses track of his tiger friend. The second year of the cubs' lives, they now full fledged adult tigers, is different than their first, with a question being how their individual experiences in captivity will affect how they function in their much different new environments. Both Aidan and Raoul are determined to do whatever necessary to make sure what happens to the tigers are for the benefit of the lives they should be leading based on their history, with Aidan and Raoul perhaps having a different perspective on what that actually is.<br />

big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

                            13. Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1.

I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

                        <p>"The Two Brothers" is a short story by Tolstoy that explores the themes of greed, envy, and the destructive power of materialism. The story follows two brothers, Ivan and Pyotr, who inherit a large sum of money from their father. Ivan, the older brother, is content with his simple life as a farmer, while Pyotr becomes consumed with his desire for wealth and power.</p><p></p><p>One of the strengths of the story is its ability to convey the destructive nature of Pyotr's obsession with material possessions. As he becomes increasingly focused on acquiring wealth, Pyotr becomes increasingly isolated from those around him, including his own family. His pursuit of money leads him down a path of deception and betrayal, ultimately resulting in his own downfall.</p><p></p><p>Another strength of the story is its use of vivid imagery to convey the stark contrast between the two brothers. While Ivan is described as being content with his simple life, Pyotr is depicted as being constantly consumed with a burning desire for more. This contrast not only highlights the destructive nature of Pyotr's greed but also serves to underscore the importance of contentment and gratitude in our own lives.</p><p></p><p>However, one potential weakness of the story is its somewhat heavy-handed moralizing. While the themes explored in "The Two Brothers" are important and relevant, the story can feel a bit didactic at times, with Tolstoy's message often taking precedence over character development and plot.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a thought-provoking story that offers important insights into the destructive nature of greed and materialism. While it may be a bit heavy-handed at times, its themes remain relevant today, making it a worthwhile read for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of the human experience.</p><p></p><br />

                        Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers: Bata served his elder brother Anubis like a son. Bata had prodigious strength and the power to understand animals. One day as they were plowing, Anubis sent Bata back to the house for more seed. The wife was smitten with mighty Bata and tried to seduce him, only to be rejected: "You are like a mother to me and your husband like a father...". Virtuous to a fault, he promised not to tell her shame. But she faked a beating (swallowing rancid fat to induce vomiting) and when Anubis returned she told him that Bata had raped her. So Anubis waits in ambush in the stable. But the lead cow warns Bata and he flees. Re-Harakhti intervenes and draws a river full of crocodiles between Bata and his pursuer. From the far side of the river Bata protests his innocence. And to prove his claim he calls Re to witness and castrates himself (penis and all) casting the genitals into the river. Anubis is thus convinced of his innocence. Thereupon Bata weakens and seems to depart this life, journeying to the Valley of the Pine (?), telling his brother that he must come to resurrect him when a sign appears. When Anubis finds that beer ferments in his cup, he will know that Bata has perished and he must go to save him. For Bata will take out his heart and lodge it in the pine flower (?) at the top of the tree. When the sign comes to him, Anubis must go and find the heart and restore it to life in a basin of water. Anubis returns home, kills his wife and gives her carcase to the dogs. Bata in the Valley of the Pine is blessed by the Ennead. On order of Re, Khnum fashions for Bata a wife of supreme beauty, "the ichor of every god is in her." But it is not a happy match, for "she sat in the house while he spent the days hunting desert game." He warned her not to go outside, "lest the sea snatch you. I cannot rescue you ... because I am a woman like you...?" Nonetheless she ventures out, the tide surges around her and captures a tress of her hair (that snagged on the pine); and the sea then carries the tress back to Egypt. There the fragrance of the tress so permeates the waters that the clothing of pharoah becomes scented from washing in it. Pharoah learns from his scribes that this tress belongs to "a daughter of Re-Harakhti in whom is the ichor of every god." So he sends out envoys to search for her; she is found in the valley of the pine and brought back to Egypt. There she delights the king and demands that he send soldier to cut down the great pine (wherein is the heart of Bata) The next day when Anubis takes his barley beer, it ferments in his cup; he takes wine and it sours. So, recognizing the sign, he sets out for the Valley of the Pine. There he finds Bata's body and searches 3 years for the heart. When he has nearly given up he finds it, puts in a basin of water. And as the heart soaks the water, the body of Bata takes life and twitches. Anubis gives him the basin to drink, and his heart is restored. The two brothers are reunited. Then by Bata's plan, they journey to Egypt, Bata himself disguised as a great Bull, Anubis riding on his back. Pharoah is impressed and honors Anubis. But Bata the Bull reveals himself to the Wife (now wife of Pharoah) and she contrives to have him slaughtered by tricking pharoah into a promise; she demands, "let me eat the liver of this bull." At his slaughter two drops of the blood soak into the earth at the doorposts of the palace, and there two great Persea trees spring up, one on either side. Again Bata, now in the Persea tree, reveals himself to the treacherous Wife. And again she tricks pharoah into promising, now to cut down the trees and make furniture for her. But when the trees are felled, a splinter of the wood flies off and lodges in her mouth, and she becomes pregnant from it. Pharoah dotes upon the child as his son; he (Bata incarnate) rises to be Crown Prince. When Pharoah dies, the new Pharoah--Bata triumphant-- condemns the treacherous wife--and mother! He elevates Anubis to Crown Prince. And after his reign of 30 years, at Bata's death, Anubis succeeds him.<br />

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

                        Paragraph 1 (Introduction):<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy's "The Two Brothers" is a short story about two brothers who inherit their father's farm and learn to deal with their conflicting personalities and desires. The story is set in the countryside of Russia during the 19th century and explores themes of family, responsibility, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Paragraph 2 (Body):<br /><br />The main characters in "The Two Brothers" are not related to me, but I found their personalities relatable in many ways. While one brother is driven by a desire for success and wealth, the other is content with a simple life. This dichotomy reminded me of my own experiences with family and friends who have different priorities and values.<br />The setting of the story is effective in creating a vivid picture of life in rural Russia during the 19th century. Tolstoy's descriptions of the countryside and the changing seasons help to bring the story to life. For example, when describing the winter landscape, Tolstoy writes: "The white, untrodden snow stretched over the whole valley, reflecting the rays of the sun, and its cold, sparkling crystals seemed to penetrate the very soul."<br />The plot of "The Two Brothers" is interesting, but it may not be to everyone's taste. The story is slow-paced and focuses on the inner lives of the characters, rather than action or suspense. However, this allows for a deeper exploration of the themes of family, responsibility, and happiness. The climax of the story is unexpected and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br />The conflict in "The Two Brothers" is clear and realistic, as it deals with the struggle between two brothers who have different ideas about how to run their farm. This conflict is something that many people can relate to, as it is common for family members to have different goals and desires.<br />The theme of "The Two Brothers" is that happiness cannot be found through wealth and material possessions alone. This is demonstrated through the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom values success and wealth, while the other is content with a simple life. The story suggests that true happiness comes from living a fulfilling life that is in line with one's values and priorities.<br />Paragraph 3 (Conclusion):<br /><br />Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a well-written and thought-provoking story that explores important themes related to family, responsibility, and happiness. While it may not be to everyone's taste, the slow pace and emphasis on character development allow for a deeper exploration of these themes. The story has enduring value, as it provides a timeless lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life that is true to one's values.<br />

                            28. The Prodigal Son Luke 15: 11-32 A man had two sons. One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</h2><br />

                        Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers: Bata served his elder brother Anubis like a son. Bata had prodigious strength and the power to understand animals. One day as they were plowing, Anubis sent Bata back to the house for more seed. The wife was smitten with mighty Bata and tried to seduce him, only to be rejected: "You are like a mother to me and your husband like a father...". Virtuous to a fault, he promised not to tell her shame. But she faked a beating (swallowing rancid fat to induce vomiting) and when Anubis returned she told him that Bata had raped her. So Anubis waits in ambush in the stable. But the lead cow warns Bata and he flees. Re-Harakhti intervenes and draws a river full of crocodiles between Bata and his pursuer. From the far side of the river Bata protests his innocence. And to prove his claim he calls Re to witness and castrates himself (penis and all) casting the genitals into the river. Anubis is thus convinced of his innocence. Thereupon Bata weakens and seems to depart this life, journeying to the Valley of the Pine (?), telling his brother that he must come to resurrect him when a sign appears. When Anubis finds that beer ferments in his cup, he will know that Bata has perished and he must go to save him. For Bata will take out his heart and lodge it in the pine flower (?) at the top of the tree. When the sign comes to him, Anubis must go and find the heart and restore it to life in a basin of water. Anubis returns home, kills his wife and gives her carcase to the dogs. Bata in the Valley of the Pine is blessed by the Ennead. On order of Re, Khnum fashions for Bata a wife of supreme beauty, "the ichor of every god is in her." But it is not a happy match, for "she sat in the house while he spent the days hunting desert game." He warned her not to go outside, "lest the sea snatch you. I cannot rescue you ... because I am a woman like you...?" Nonetheless she ventures out, the tide surges around her and captures a tress of her hair (that snagged on the pine); and the sea then carries the tress back to Egypt. There the fragrance of the tress so permeates the waters that the clothing of pharoah becomes scented from washing in it. Pharoah learns from his scribes that this tress belongs to "a daughter of Re-Harakhti in whom is the ichor of every god." So he sends out envoys to search for her; she is found in the valley of the pine and brought back to Egypt. There she delights the king and demands that he send soldier to cut down the great pine (wherein is the heart of Bata) The next day when Anubis takes his barley beer, it ferments in his cup; he takes wine and it sours. So, recognizing the sign, he sets out for the Valley of the Pine. There he finds Bata's body and searches 3 years for the heart. When he has nearly given up he finds it, puts in a basin of water. And as the heart soaks the water, the body of Bata takes life and twitches. Anubis gives him the basin to drink, and his heart is restored. The two brothers are reunited. Then by Bata's plan, they journey to Egypt, Bata himself disguised as a great Bull, Anubis riding on his back. Pharoah is impressed and honors Anubis. But Bata the Bull reveals himself to the Wife (now wife of Pharoah) and she contrives to have him slaughtered by tricking pharoah into a promise; she demands, "let me eat the liver of this bull." At his slaughter two drops of the blood soak into the earth at the doorposts of the palace, and there two great Persea trees spring up, one on either side. Again Bata, now in the Persea tree, reveals himself to the treacherous Wife. And again she tricks pharoah into promising, now to cut down the trees and make furniture for her. But when the trees are felled, a splinter of the wood flies off and lodges in her mouth, and she becomes pregnant from it. Pharoah dotes upon the child as his son; he (Bata incarnate) rises to be Crown Prince. When Pharoah dies, the new Pharoah--Bata triumphant-- condemns the treacherous wife--and mother! He elevates Anubis to Crown Prince. And after his reign of 30 years, at Bata's death, Anubis succeeds him.<br />
