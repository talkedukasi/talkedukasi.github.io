By Langston Hughes
I, too, sing America
I am the darker brother
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh,
And eat well
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody will dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen"
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed
I, too, am America

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor

To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin

The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                            8. I, TOO, SING AMERICA
By Langston Hughes
I, too, sing America
I am the darker brother
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh,
And eat well
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody will dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen"
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed
I, too, am America

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Because he speaks from the point of view of an oppressed African-American the poem's struggles and future changes seem to be of greater importance than they ordinarily would. The point of view of being the oppressed African American is clearly evident in Langston Hughes's writing.<p></p>2.In the poem, Hughes describes a ubiquitous racial oppression that degrades African Americans at the time. He writes from the perspective of an inferior servant to a domineering white family that shoos him away to the kitchen whenever company arrives.<p></p>3.The poem expresses how he felt like an unforgotten American citizen because of his skin color. In the short poem, Hughes proclaims that he, too, is an American, even though the dominant members of society are constantly pushing him aside and hiding him away because he is an African American.<p></p>4.In large graven letters on the wall of the newly opened National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall is a quote from poet Langston Hughes: “I, too, am  America.<p></p>5.In a community where people are being treated fair everyone works together, solves problems easily, has fun, cares for one another, feels safe and gets along. That is a way that many people want to live. It should be important to a person to act with fairness. If you do this people will respect and trust you.<p></p>6.We cannot form the I-Thou relationships that Buber speaks of until we have learned to notice, soothe, and understand the emotions and patterns of our threat brain. When in threat, we are always compelled to use other people as objects who can save and protect us, or who we can blame for our problems.<p></p>7.=Encourage children to stand up for a friend if someone else is calling them namesm<p></p>=Encourage all children to follow rules and make sure the rules are the same for everyone.<p></p>=Sharing things with others is a great way of encouraging equality and fairness.<p></p>8.The dentist says she is not prepared to treat her anymore because of her behaviour. The dentist is refusing Jeannette a service because of behaviour related to her disability. This may be discrimination arising from disability.<p></p>9.Creating an inclusive culture that has respect for all cultures and religions.<p></p>10.Central to ILO’s work since its founding in 1919 is promotion of equality between women and men and ending discrimination in the world of work. Combating discrimination through promotion of equality is an essential component in the Decent Work Common Agenda.  Discrimination stifles development opportunities for workers, indigenous and tribal peoples, women, children, people with disabilities, workers with HIV/AIDS, and other socially isolated sectors of society.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>( &lt;&gt; )<p></p><br />

By Judith Kempis
