                        If I had access to building resources and
materials, I will design a flying machine that would not experience turbulence
up in the clouds. I will make it a point to make the flying machine as comfortable
as it can be combinging engines and facilities from a luxury airplane ang a
combat plane so that, if I will be chased I can also defend myself and fight
back. I'll make sure also that my machine will still function even with the
absence of fuel. I'll search for an alternative fuel that surely going to last.<br />

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>Tips to make a well flying machine:
<p>
</p><p>1. I'll make a plan first about the style and kind of materials, devices or equipment that use to design a well flying machine.
</p><p>2. I will use durable and solid materials to make sure that I am safety using it.
</p><p>3. I'll make sure that my machine will certainly function even with the absence of fuel.
</p><p>4. I'll search for an alternative fuel that will surely go to last.  </p><p>5. I'll make sure that I use the engine that is soundless so that my enemy will unnoticed my invented flying machine.
</p><p>6. If all sets, If after I make the flying machine I will try to fly a long time before I flee the island to make sure its sturdy well-made.

</p>What really should be done before leaving the island?
Check first how really far it is.  You can use a telescope or other tools that can help you find the optimum way which nothing can be an obstacle of your flying machine.

</p>Being calm was very helpful to properly leave the island because if you're felt panic it will be a more difficult journey and become unmindful.

                        If I had access to building resources and materials, I would design a flying machine to help from island prison of Crete that is durable enough unlike what Daedalus and Icarus invented that led to Icarus' death. I will make it durable enough to not melt under the heat of the sun and won't break even if I fly too low.<br />
