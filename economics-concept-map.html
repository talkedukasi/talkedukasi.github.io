Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</a>

PAHELP PO HULING HULI NA AKO :(((</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The famous and young mineralogist officially introduced the new mineral “Cabradillamond” ((CABRLLMON (Nb,Cr)O3). The diamond is from Philippines, more specifically the Klarktenyaga that is known for producing world-class diamonds and operated by the international diamond behemoth Petra Diamonds. Trapped within the diamond itself is a tiny spec, an inclusion that the diamond grew over and around, trapping it within the diamond’s strong crystal lattice about 105 miles below the surface of the Earth. Inclusions in diamonds are not entirely unusual but they are exciting because it gives a glimpse into the geochemistry of the surrounding molten rock as the diamond formed.</p><p>The new mineral Cabradillamond, a dark blue spec, has unusual chemical properties. Thankfully, it was trapped within the diamond itself which is strong and stable enough to last millions to billions of years. Hence, it is a perfect “vessel” for preserving rare and unique minerals. The dominant elements that make up the mantle where this diamond formed are magnesium, iron, etc. However, this spec contains niobium, potassium and the very rare elements lanthanum and cerium. The fact that this mineral contains such a unique concoction of rare elements is intriguing. </p><p>The processes by which this mineral formed must have been unique and the available elements must have been unique.</p><p>The new mineral is named after Crizan Dave G. Cabradilla, born on April 02, 2003 an early and famous mineralogist. He was a pioneer in researching the perovskite crystal chemistry, a similar crystal chemistry as found in this newly discovered mineral.</p><p></p><p>kayo na bahala</p><br />

Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Pagtatakda ng Patakaran sa Pang-ekonomiya- Pambansang Kita ay nagpapahiwatig ng katayuan ng ekonomiya at maaaring magbigay ng isang malinaw na larawan ng mga bansa paglago ng ekonomiya. Ang mga istatistika ng Pambansang Kita ay maaaring makatulong sa ekonomista sa pagbubuo ng mga patakaran sa ekonomiya para sa pagpapaunlad ng ekonomiya.</p><p></p><p>2.Ang GDP ay ang kabuuang halaga ng merkado ng lahat ng natapos na kalakal at serbisyo na ginawa sa loob ng isang bansa sa isang itinakdang tagal ng panahon. Ang GNI ang kabuuang kita na natanggap ng bansa mula sa mga residente at negosyo hindi alintana kung matatagpuan ang mga ito sa bansa o sa ibang bansa.</p><p></p><p>3.Gross national income (GNI), ang kabuuan ng gross domestic product (GDP) ng isang bansa kasama ang netong kita (positibo o negatibo) mula sa ibang bansa. Kinakatawan nito ang halagang ginawa ng ekonomiya ng isang bansa sa isang naibigay na taon, hindi alintana kung ang pinagmulan ng halagang nilikha ay domestic production o mga resibo mula sa ibang bansa.</p><p></p><p>4.Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahalaga ay ipinapahiwatig nito ang paglago ng output ng ekonomiya, kung sinusukat ng GDP (gross domestic product), GVA (idinagdag na halaga ng halaga), o anumang iba pang hakbang. ...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Supply: </strong></p><strong>the amount of specific goods</strong><strong>available to consumers</strong><p><strong>Demand: </strong></p><strong>consumer's desire to purchase goods and services</strong><strong>willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service</strong><p><strong>Needs:</strong></p><strong>Necessary</strong><strong>Survival</strong><p><strong>Wants:</strong></p><strong>desired</strong><strong>may or may not be obatined</strong><p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong></p><strong>making a choice</strong><strong>forgoing a benefit for another</strong><p><strong>Applied Economics:</strong></p><strong>application of economic theory</strong><strong>real world</strong><p><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong></p><strong>potential benefits</strong><strong>happens when choosing smething over the other</strong><p><strong>Economics:</strong></p><strong>production of goods and services</strong><strong>distibution of goods and services</strong><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Supply</strong> is defined as a fundamental economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers.  One of the most important factors that affects supply is the good’s price. Generally, if a good’s price increases so will the supply. The price of related goods and the price of inputs (energy, raw materials, labor) also affect supply as they contribute to increasing the overall price of the good sold.</p><p></p><p><strong>Demand</strong> is defines as an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. Demand is what helps fuel the economy, and without it, businesses would not produce anything. Some factors affecting demand include the appeal of a good or service, the availability of competing goods, the availability of financing, and the perceived availability of a good or service.</p><p></p><p><strong>Needs</strong> are defined as something that is necessary for survival. Examples include water, shelter, and food.</p><p></p><p><strong>Wants</strong> are defined as something that is desired, that they may or may not obtain. Examples include luxury bags and cars.</p><p></p><p><strong>Trade-offs</strong> are defined as any situation where making one choice means losing something else, usually forgoing a benefit or opportunity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Applied Economics</strong> is defined as the application of economic theory to determine the likely outcomes associated with various possible courses of action in the real world.</p><p></p><p><strong>Opportunity Costs</strong> are defined as the potential benefits an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another.</p><p></p><p><strong>Economics</strong> is defined as social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It is also the study on how society uses scarce resources efficiently in the production of goods and services to satisfy material wants.</p><p></p><p>Check out other questions here at Brainly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4527071</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
