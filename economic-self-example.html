Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

Cooperatives contribute to the economy by ensuring the production and sale of  goods while also lending economic assistance to those in need.For example, as an agricultural cooperative helps farmers sell their produce both to members and non- members of the cooperative, pooling the earnings and distributing it among the farmers. The cooperative also helps them buy the supplies and equipment needed for farming.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>On the other hand, trade unions are organizations of workers who join together to achieve common goals such as better working conditions, wages, and benefits. They aim to protect and advance the interests of their members through collective bargaining with employers.</p><p></p><p>Trade unions provide a voice for workers, allowing them to negotiate with employers on equal footing. By pooling their resources and negotiating collectively, trade unions can often achieve better outcomes for their members than individual workers could on their own. They also help to promote workplace safety, fair treatment, and equal opportunities for all workers.</p><p></p><p>For example, a trade union may negotiate with an employer on behalf of its members for a higher wage rate, better benefits, and safer working conditions. The union may also provide its members with legal assistance and representation in the event of a dispute with the employer.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while cooperatives and trade unions have different purposes, they both serve to empower individuals and promote their collective interests. Cooperatives help individuals to own and control the means of production, while trade unions help workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. Both of these types of organizations play important roles in ensuring fair and equitable economic outcomes for individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it helps.</p><p>Pa brainlest answer po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are two forms of collective organizations that are established to represent the interests of individuals in the economy. The purpose of this report is to discuss the concept of cooperatives and trade unions, their similarities and differences, and the role they play in the economy.</p><p></p><p>Definition of Cooperatives:</p><p>According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), cooperatives are autonomous associations of individuals who voluntarily unite to meet their economic, social, and cultural needs through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise. The members of cooperatives own, control, finance, and benefit from the products or services they offer in their organization.</p><p></p><p>Characteristics of Cooperatives:</p><p>Cooperatives embody the characteristics of a self-sustaining communal society. They are owned and controlled by their members, who elect a board of directors to oversee the operations of the organization. They are democratically controlled, with each member having one vote. Cooperatives are also self-financing, with members pooling their resources to provide capital for the organization. Finally, cooperatives operate on the principle of equitable distribution of benefits, with profits shared among members based on their participation.</p><p></p><p>Examples of Cooperatives:</p><p>Cooperatives exist in various sectors of the economy, including agriculture, finance, housing, and healthcare. For example, an agricultural cooperative helps farmers sell their produce, pool the earnings, and distribute them among the farmers. The cooperative also assists them in purchasing supplies and equipment needed for farming.</p><p></p><p>Definition of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions are organizations of workers that seek to protect and advance the interests of their members. They negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers on wages, benefits, and working conditions. Trade unions also provide support for their members, including legal representation, job training, and health and safety programs.</p><p></p><p>Characteristics of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions are democratic organizations, with members electing their leaders and voting on important decisions. They are also collective organizations, with members bargaining collectively with employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Trade unions operate on the principle of solidarity, with members supporting each other to achieve their common goals.</p><p></p><p>Examples of Trade Unions:</p><p>Trade unions exist in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, and transportation. For example, the National Education Association (NEA) is a trade union that represents teachers and education support professionals in the United States. The NEA negotiates collective bargaining agreements with school districts on behalf of its members and provides support for its members, including professional development, legal representation, and advocacy.</p><p></p><p>Similarities and Differences between Cooperatives and Trade Unions:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are similar in that they are both collective organizations that seek to represent the interests of their members. They are also both democratic organizations, with members electing their leaders and voting on important decisions. However, there are also significant differences between cooperatives and trade unions. Cooperatives are organizations of individuals who own and control their own enterprise, while trade unions are organizations of workers who negotiate with employers on behalf of their members. Cooperatives operate on the principle of equitable distribution of benefits, while trade unions seek to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Cooperatives and trade unions are important forms of collective organizations that represent the interests of individuals in the economy. Cooperatives provide a means for individuals to own and control their own enterprise, while trade unions provide a means for workers to negotiate with employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Both cooperatives and trade unions are democratic organizations that operate on the principle of solidarity, with members supporting each other to achieve their common goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
