FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable

To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.

For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.

The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.
