                                            MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</a>

                        <p>The indigenous water transportation of the Philippines is an important aspect of the country's maritime heritage. Before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century, the people of the Philippines already had an advanced system of water transportation.</p><p></p><p>One of the most common types of indigenous watercraft in the Philippines is the "banca," a narrow and long canoe-like boat made of wood. Bancas can vary in size, from small ones used for fishing and short trips, to larger ones used for transportation of goods and people between islands. Some bancas are equipped with outriggers or "katig," which help stabilize the boat and prevent it from tipping over.</p><p></p><p>Another type of indigenous watercraft is the "vinta," a colorful sailboat traditionally used by the Badjao or sea gypsies in the southern Philippines. Vintas have a distinctive triangular sail made of cloth and bamboo, and are often adorned with colorful flags and other decorations.</p><p></p><p>The "paraw" is another traditional boat commonly used in the Visayas region. It is a double-outrigger sailboat that is known for its speed and agility. The paraw is often used for fishing, transportation, and as a recreational vessel.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these types of boats, there are also other indigenous watercraft in the Philippines, such as the "lantsa" or larger wooden boats, and the "baroto" or dugout canoe.</p><p></p><p>Today, modern boats and ships have replaced many of the traditional watercraft in the Philippines, but some of these indigenous boats are still in use in rural areas and for traditional activities such as fishing and festivals.</p><p></p><br />

                            6. MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</h2><br />

What could be the effect of this on the amount of groundwater in the country? 5. The Philippines is surrounded by different bodies of water. How can this be utilized by our countrymen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. Different uses of freshwater:</strong></p><p>Drinking and household use: Freshwater is essential for human consumption, including drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene.</p><p>Agriculture: Freshwater is used for irrigation to support crop growth and agriculture.</p><p>Industry: Many industries require freshwater for various processes, such as manufacturing, power generation, and cooling.</p><p>Hydropower: Freshwater is a vital resource for generating hydropower, which is a renewable energy source.</p><p>Ecosystem support: Freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands, provide habitats for numerous species and support biodiversity.</p><p><strong>2. Source of drinking water:</strong></p><p>The water we drink typically comes from various sources, including:</p><p>Surface water: This includes water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that undergo treatment processes to ensure its safety for drinking.</p><p>Groundwater: Water extracted from underground aquifers through wells and undergoes treatment before distribution.</p><p>Municipal water supply: Many urban areas have centralized water treatment facilities that treat and distribute water to households and businesses.</p><p><strong>3. Water transportation and traffic situation in the Philippines:</strong></p><p>Water transportation can help alleviate traffic congestion in the Philippines by providing an alternative mode of transportation, particularly in areas near bodies of water. For example:</p><p>Ferries and boats: Waterways can be utilized to transport people and goods, especially in coastal areas and regions with rivers and lakes.</p><p>Water taxis: In cities with accessible water channels, water taxis or similar services can offer an alternative means of transportation, reducing road congestion.</p><p>By diverting some traffic to water-based transportation options, it can help ease the burden on congested roads, reduce travel times, and provide additional mobility choices for commuters.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Effects of unregulated deep well use on groundwater in the Philippines:</strong></p><p>Unregulated use of deep wells can lead to excessive groundwater extraction without proper management. This can have several negative effects:</p><p>Depletion of groundwater: Uncontrolled extraction can lower the water table, reducing the available groundwater and potentially leading to water scarcity.</p><p>Saltwater intrusion: In coastal areas, excessive pumping of groundwater can allow saltwater to intrude into freshwater aquifers, making the water unsuitable for consumption or agricultural use.</p><p>Land subsidence: Over-pumping of groundwater can lead to land subsidence or sinking, causing damage to infrastructure and ecosystems<br /><br /><strong>5. Utilizing the bodies of water surrounding the Philippines:</strong></p><p>The bodies of water surrounding the Philippines offer several opportunities for utilization by the countrymen, such as:</p><p>Fisheries and aquaculture: The coastal waters provide a rich fishing ground and support aquaculture activities, contributing to food security and livelihoods.</p><p></p><br />
