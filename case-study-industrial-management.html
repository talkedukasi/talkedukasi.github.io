This case study is set in a rural area that has a significant local fishing and fish processing industry, and fish is an important part of the local diet. Banning harvesting and sale of fish, while addressing the public health and safety risk, may not be the optimal solution as it does not take into account factors such as the importance of fish in the diet, the loss of an important source of protein for many, the loss of livelihoods for fishers, and the impact on the fish processing industry.1.DEFINE THE DECISION PROBLEM.2.IDENTIFY AND SELECT RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS.3.DEVELOP A RANGE OF DECISION FACTORS AND CRITERIA BY WHICH THEOPTIONS WILL BE ASSESSED.4.GATHER EVIDENCE, EVALUATE AND COMPARE ALTERNATIVES (RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS).5.CHOOSE THE BEST OPTION (ALTERNATIVE).​</a>

1) He believes a manager crosses the threshold into entrepreneurship when “the exercise of his/her judgment is prone to error and s/he bears responsibility for its correctness.” 
 2) His studies resulted in something resembling a broad theory of entrepreneurship with three separate functions: “scientific understanding of the product; entrepreneurial indust ry – the application of information to a practical purpose; and productive industry – the human labor manufacturing of the item.” 
3) He viewed innovation as arising from new comb inations of materials and forces. He provided the following five cases of new combinations. 
 4) Entrepreneurs are those who make money through exchanges. 
 5) Entrepreneurs are rewarded in exchange for anticipating the effects of uncertainty and selling their products at a price that exceeds their input costs. 
 6) Profit is the reward that entrepreneurs get from assuming uninsurable risks. 
7) His research focuses on the workings of the capitalist system. Manufacturers should borrow less and downsize their workforces if demand falls. They should do the opposite when demand is high. 
8) Ranked goods according to t heir causal connections to human satisfaction. 
9) He was interested in learning how everyone fits into the economic system. The economy, according to Smith, is driven by self - int erest in the marketplace.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

Founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan, Liam Lonergan, and Tony Ryan, the original airline offered service from Waterford in southeastern Ireland to Gatwick in London. In its first full year of operation under partial European Union (EU) deregulation, the small airline obtained permission to challenge the duopoly of Air Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin–London route. With two routes and two planes, this small Irish airline was off and running. By 1991, the airline had been running continuous losses; it abandoned its business-class product and discontinued its frequent flyer club.To save the company from ruin and make the airline profitable, Michael O’Leary, the CEO, visited America to borrow ideas from Southwest Airlines, a well-established low- cost carrier. He returned with several key elements for a no-frills model, including the importance of quick turnaround times, no extras, and a single aircraft for operating efficiency. With an additional Ryan family investment of ð20 million, the firm emerged from restructuring as Europe’s first low-fare airline, making a profit for the first time. Deregulation of the European airline industry in 1992 gave carriers from any EU country the right to operate a schedule between other EU states, paving the way for Ryanair to begin launching new routes throughout Europe.Today the airline serves more than 42 million passengers, with 2007 profits of ð401.4 million. A comparison of 2007 to 2006 performance shows profit growth of 33 percent, traffic growth of 22 percent, revenue growth of 32 percent, and yield increases of 7 per- cent. Ryanair’s passenger numbers have grown by up to 25 percent per year for most of the last decade. With plans to double traffic and profits by 2012, Ryanair continues to execute on its low-cost strategy by offering low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a dedication to cost containment and operating efficiencies.The key elements of Ryanair’s strategy are low fares to stimulate demand, and customer service in the form of punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its primary competitors had. To accomplish these activities, Ryanair stresses quick turn- around times for aircraft, and chooses point-to-point short-haul routes to secondary and regional airports versus hub-and-spoke service. Short-haul and point-to-point service allows for direct nonstop service and avoids the cost of service for connecting passengers, including baggage transfer and passenger assistance. These regional airports offer lower landing and handling charges, faster turnaround times, less congestion, and fewer terminal delays. Ryanair negotiates extremely aggressive contracts with its airports, demanding low fees as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline plays airports off against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere if the airport does not make further concessions.Lower operating costs also come from aircraft equipment costs and personnel productivity. Operating a fleet of aircraft with a single model, the Boeing 737-800 series pro- vides operating efficiencies in maintenance and pilot scheduling. Taking advantage of the slump in airplane2 / 2sales, the company ordered Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 2001 at a substantial discount. Additional savings have come from more recent orders of aircraft without window shades, seat-back recline, or seat-back pockets. Reduced cleaning and repair costs for these planes have accompanied the savings of several hundred thousand dollars per aircraft when purchasing these bare-bones planes. Third parties are used at certain airports for passenger and aircraft handling, further lowering costs. Taking advantage of the Internet, direct selling to passengers through online bookings cuts out the cost of using travel agents, with the web site now handling 96 percent of all reservations. Ryanair does not employ an advertising agency, instead producing all of its advertising material in-house.With a clear and focused strategy as a low-cost carrier, future plans include manageable growth, continuing efforts to appeal the EU commission decision to prevent acquisition of Aer Lingus, and the possibility of entering into the long-haul market with a transatlantic low-cost airline.1.

This case study is set in a rural area that has a significant local fishing and fish processing industry, and fish is an important part of the local diet. Banning harvesting and sale of fish, while addressing the public health and safety risk, may not be the optimal solution as it does not take into account factors such as the importance of fish in the diet, the loss of an important source of protein for many, the loss of livelihoods for fishers, and the impact on the fish processing industry.1.DEFINE THE DECISION PROBLEM.2.IDENTIFY AND SELECT RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS.3.DEVELOP A RANGE OF DECISION FACTORS AND CRITERIA BY WHICH THEOPTIONS WILL BE ASSESSED.4.GATHER EVIDENCE, EVALUATE AND COMPARE ALTERNATIVES (RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS).5.CHOOSE THE BEST OPTION (ALTERNATIVE).​</h2><br />

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />
