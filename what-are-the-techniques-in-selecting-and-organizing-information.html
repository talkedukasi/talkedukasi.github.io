                                            roduction (Time Rame: 15 minutes Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence an audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented. Propaganda is often associated with material that is prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations, the media, and Individuals also produce propaganda. Propaganda Techniques: 1. BANDWAGON: The basic idea behind the bandwagon approach is just that, "getting on the bandwagon. The propagandist puts forth the idea that everyone is doing this, or everyone supports this person/cause, so should you. The bandwagon approach appeals to the conformist in all of us: No one wants to be left out of what is perceived to be a popular trend. We Can Doh! I WANT YOU FOR V.S.ARNY sho tur aty119 2. TESTIMONIAL: This is the celebrity endorsement of philosophy, movement, or candidate. In advertising, for example, athletes are often paid millions of dollars to promote sports shoes, equipment, and fast food. In political circles, movie stars, television stars, rock stars, and athletes lend a great deal of credibility and power to a political cause or candidate. Just a photograph of a movie star at a political rally can generate more interest in that issue/candidate or cause thousands, sometimes millions, of people to what to do?​</a>

                            9. roduction (Time Rame: 15 minutes Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence an audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented. Propaganda is often associated with material that is prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations, the media, and Individuals also produce propaganda. Propaganda Techniques: 1. BANDWAGON: The basic idea behind the bandwagon approach is just that, "getting on the bandwagon. The propagandist puts forth the idea that everyone is doing this, or everyone supports this person/cause, so should you. The bandwagon approach appeals to the conformist in all of us: No one wants to be left out of what is perceived to be a popular trend. We Can Doh! I WANT YOU FOR V.S.ARNY sho tur aty119 2. TESTIMONIAL: This is the celebrity endorsement of philosophy, movement, or candidate. In advertising, for example, athletes are often paid millions of dollars to promote sports shoes, equipment, and fast food. In political circles, movie stars, television stars, rock stars, and athletes lend a great deal of credibility and power to a political cause or candidate. Just a photograph of a movie star at a political rally can generate more interest in that issue/candidate or cause thousands, sometimes millions, of people to what to do?​</h2><br />
