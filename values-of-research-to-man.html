                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research stimulates and ennobles the human spirit. It challenges man to remove the threat of stagnation. It is an open door to a better future and it guides him in his efforts to obtain good results which contribute to his satisfaction and self-fulfillment.</p><br />

                        The greatest discoveries were founded through research, thus the purpose of research is to imply action on a fine thought. Research, of course, has stated those which were impossible, unveiled conundrums, and such. The lack of research can: 1.) Stop the Discovery of Proof for newly-thought ideologies, 2.) Bare strip the critical thinking of humankind, and 3.) End the continuum of leveling with the current demands in Society.<br /><br />Research has proved itself worthy of keep, thus the values of it can never be numbered, however it can be appreciated more.<br /><br />-Matthew D.<br />
