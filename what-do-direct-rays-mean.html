                                            How do lenses work? Refraction is the property of light among lenses and it bends light rays as they pass through it, so they change direction. (You can read a full explanation of why this happens in our article on light.) That means the rays seem to come from a point that is closer or further away from where they originate and that is what makes objects seen through a lens seem either bigger or smaller than they really are.

A.The sun rays strike at the same direction.
B.The sun is situated in the same position.
C.The sun rays strike slanted both time of the day.
D.The sun moves vertically.
3. The sun changes its position due to the rotation of the earth on its axis. How does it affect the length and position of your shadow?
A.as the earth rotates the sun also changes its position, the length and position of your shadow changes too.
B.as the earth rotates the sun follow the same path and your shadow follows too.
C.as the earth rotates your shadow remain in its position and direction but the sun changes.
D.as the earth rotates your shadow changes its position and direction but the sun remains the same.
4. How does the changes in position of the sun and length and position of the shadows helps the farmers?
A.The length and position of the shadow helps the farmers to decide for the best time of the day they need to work in the farm.
B.The length and position of the shadow helps the farmers to decide what type of plants to be planted.
C.The length and position of the shadows helps the farmers on how to yield a good harvest.
D.The length and position of the shadows helps the farmers awareness of the insects/pests that may damage their crops.
5. The longer the shadow, the lower the sun in the horizon. The shorter the shadow the farther the sun from the horizon. What does it mean? 
A.The length of the shadow depends upon the time of the day.
B.The length of the shadow depends upon the revolution of the earth around the sun.
C.The length of the shadow depends upon the distance of the sun from the earth.

                            5. How do lenses work? Refraction is the property of light among lenses and it bends light rays as they pass through it, so they change direction. (You can read a full explanation of why this happens in our article on light.) That means the rays seem to come from a point that is closer or further away from where they originate and that is what makes objects seen through a lens seem either bigger or smaller than they really are. Frame your Writing! Write a brief report (100-150 words) differentiating concave from convex lens after completing the FRAME below.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: A lens works by refraction: it bends light rays as they pass through it so they change direction. That means the rays seem to come from a point that's closer or further away from where they originate—and that's what makes objects seen through a lens seem either bigger or smaller than they are.
