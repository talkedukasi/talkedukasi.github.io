Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

                                            Respect Begets Respect By Ma. Melanie L. Padohinog Joseph is a smart boy who loves to learn almost everything. He always excels in class the reason why his teacher adores him. He does his best just to make his parents proud of him. He dreams of becoming a policeman just like his father. One day, Mrs. Pe, their English teacher, teaches them about "adjectives" in school. The whole class is enjoying their lesson. When Mrs. Pe asked the class to give examples of adjectives, John excitedly raised his hand. He said, "Fat, Ma'am. Joseph is fat. Ha! Ha! Ha!" The whole class laughed with him. Mrs. Pe told the class, "Children, will you please excuse me? John, please come with me outside for a while." When they are outside, Mrs. Pe said, "John, do you think what you did is good? You know, shaming someone is bad. It is not good to humiliate your classmate. What do you think is the best thing that you will do now?" John answered, "Ma'am, I am very sorry. I did not realize that it will hurt you and Joseph. Don't worry, Ma'am, I will ask for an apology from Kian." "All right then, it's okay. I'm happy you understood that teasing anybody is not good. You may go to Joseph now," said Mrs. Pe with a smile. John went back inside the classroom and talked to Kian. "I'm so sorry, Joseph. I know what I did was wrong and even if you did not say anything I feel that you were hurt. I promise I won't do it again," John said humbly. "It's okay, John. I accept your apology," Joseph said happily. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where and when does the story happen? 3. Why does Ms. Pe ask Romeo to apologize to Kian? 4. What point of view is used in narrating the story? 5. If you were Kian, how would Romeo's answer to Ms. Pe make you feel? Will you accept his apology? Why or why not? 6. What is the over-all message of the story for students like you?​</a>

                                            Read the story below and answer the questions that follow.Tower to the MoonCaribbean is a group of islands surrounded by waters. On one of those islands lived a king, who was ruthless. If he said he wanted something, he had to have it.One night, when he was looking out the window, he saw a moon in the color of silver and immediately said “I want to reach it.” A few days went by; he was thinking and thinking “How can I reach that silver moon?” Then it occurred to him “I need a tall tower to reach it.”Next day, he called a royal carpenter and said “I want you to build a tower so tall that it will reach the moon.” The carpenter knew that he shouldn’t be disagreeing with the king, but he pleaded “Your majesty, it is impossible. The tower will crumble before itreaches the moon.”“There is no such thing as impossible in this kingdom” shouted the king “I want you to come back tomorrow morning and give me your plan how you’re going to build the tower.” The carpenter knew not to say anything else, so he left.He knew how to make nice furniture, but he had no idea how to build such talltower. He thought and thought and then looking at his furniture said “I know I will pile up lots of wooden chests up to the sky.” The following day, the carpenter presented his idea to the king.“Great idea” said the king. He ordered his royal staff to search all the houses in the kingdom for strong chests. “If somebody refuses” said the king “Then remind them that if they don’t like to share the wooden chests, then they’ll be sharing a royal prison rooms.”Scared people wouldn’t refuse the king, so they handed their chests. Once all the chests were collected, a tower started growing outside the palace. It was a very unique and colorful tower filled with smaller and bigger chests, carved and painted chests. It was almost like a rainbow trying to reach the sky.Unfortunately, all the chests in the kingdom were not enough to reach the sky. So the king ordered the carpenter to make more chests. The carpenter got busy with making more chests and piling them up. Unfortunately, all the wood in the kingdom was not enough to reach the sky. So the king ordered the carpenter to cut all the trees. “Your majesty” pleaded the carpenter “We can’t cut all the trees.”“What do you mean we can’t” yelled the king “There is no such thing as can’t in this kingdom.” So the carpenter knew not to say anything else. He left to cut all the trees. He got busy with making more chests and piling them up. It seemed as the tower was reaching the sky. “It’s time to reach the moon” said the king and started climbing the tower made of chests.He reached the last chest, stood on his toes, stretched out his both arms and he almost touched the moon. “We need one more chest” shouted the king. “Your majesty we don’t have any more chests, any more wood or trees” pleaded the carpenter again. “Can’t you think of something or do I have to think for you” yelled the king “Just pull one chest from the bottom and bring it to the top.”The carpenter couldn’t believe what the king was saying. “If I pull a chest from the bottom, then the whole tower will crumble. He can’t be serious” thought the carpenter. “Did you hear me” hollered the king.“As you wish” answered the carpenter and he pulled the chest at the bottom. Do you know what happened to the king? He got lost among all those tumbling down chests and that was the end of him and his ruthless ruling.Questions:What was the king’s dream?_________________________________________________________________________________What did he ask the carpenter to do?_________________________________________________________________________________Was the carpenter able to do the task at once? Why? Why not?_________________________________________________________________________________How did the carpenter and his helpers find a solution to the problem?_________________________________________________________________________________What did the king do when the tower was finished?_______________________________________________________________________________Was the king able to reach the moon?

By Ma. Melanie L. Padohinog
Kian is a smart boy who loves to learn almost everything. He always
excels in class the reason why his teacher adores him. He does all his best just
to make his parents proud of him. He dreams of becoming a policeman just
like his father.
One day, in school, Mrs. Pe, their English teacher, is teaching them
about “adjectives”. The whole class is enjoying their lesson. When Mrs. Pe
asked the class to give examples of adjectives, Romeo excitedly raised his hand.
He said, “Fat, Ma’am. Kian is fat. Ha!Ha!Ha!” The whole class laughed with him.
Mrs. Pe told the class, “Children, will you please excuse me? Romeo, please
come with me outside for a while.”When they are outside, Mrs. Pe said, “Romeo, do you think what you did
is good? You know, shaming someone is bad. It is not good to humiliate your
classmate. What do you think is the best thing that you will do now?”
Romeo answered, “Ma’am, I am very sorry. I did not realize that it will
hurt you and Kian. Don’t worry, Ma’am, I will ask an apology from Kian.”
“All right then, it’s okay. I’m happy that you understood that it is not
good to tease anybody. You may go to Kian now,” said Mrs. Pe with a smile.
Romeo went back inside the classroom and talked to Kian.
“I’m so sorry, Kian. I know what I did was wrong and even if you did not
say anything I feel that you were hurt. I promise I won’t do it again,” Romeo
said humbly.
“It’s okay, Romeo. I accept your apology,” Kian said happily.
To respect someone is to show consideration. It can boost the self-esteem
of another person.

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.

a. It seems impossible to get rid of the corona virus because it is still invisible to everybody’s eyes and we can get infected by it anytime, anywhere.
b. It seems impossible for us humans to live on Mars, but NASA is continuously developing scientific expertise needed in order to equip humans to counter asteroids by the year 2025 and preparing space explorations bound for Mars by the year 2030.
c. It seems impossible to create our own sun because we are not simply the Creator (God). However, Chinese scientists have managed to create an artificial sun that could eventually be used as an inexhaustible source of power solving the world energy crisis.
d. It seems impossible to fly for we are not birds who have wings, but through intellect and will, the Wright Brothers were able to create the wright flyer of 1903 which was the first powered airplane to demonstrate sustainable flight under the full control of the pilot.
27. Which of the following situations supports this statement by Kaplan: “Hesitation marks the opening of possibility, attention marks the fixing of possibility, and choice marks the closing of possibility.” *
a. Anna Mae has given the opportunity to become an events host, for they were able to see the potential on her to be one someday. However, she doubted her skills and experiences for it’s her first time to become a host in a prestigious event. Because of it, she decided to decline the offer and wait for the perfect time that she will be ready.
b. Louie was appointed to become the project head of their company and he will be sent abroad. He became hesitant about it for he will be far away from his family, but then he realized that this has been his dream position ever since. So, he accepted the offer and believe in his self that he can do it.
c. Both A and B
d. None of the above
28. Floods, landslides, and wildfires are just of the many natural disasters that happens every year and in every part of the globe. However, as time passes by, these natural disasters became worse and caused detrimental effects to humans than ever before. With that, is there something we can do in order to prevent this? *
a. Yes. We can always pray to God and ask to stop these natural disasters to occur
b. No. Because as human beings, we don’t have any special powers to prevent something huge like natural disasters.
c. Yes. By eliminating human induced activities such as deforestation, illegal mining and quarrying, improper waste disposal and a lot more.
d. No. From the word itself, natural, so everything that happened inside our planet occurs naturally and we can’t really do something about it as humans.
29. Three years ago, on the same month of September, two massive landslides have occurred and devasted the town of Itogon in Benguet and the city of Naga in Cebu, which have claimed many lives and damage to properties. Both were triggered by their mountainsides getting soaked with water, however it was also aggravated by small-scale mining and a quarry near the landslide sites. With that, what is the best conclusion you can make from this phenomena? *
a. Landslides are naturally occurring disasters that are usually triggered by rainfalls brought by typhoons and monsoons. Since it happens naturally, we can’t really do something about it, but maybe evacuate, as soon as possible knowing that it is a landslide prone area.
b. There is mining and a quarry but it is not the sole reason why the landslides happen because during that time, the town of Itogon was affected by Typhoon Ompong(Mangkhut) and continuous rain in Naga City, Cebu brought by habagat or the southwest monsoon
c. Knowing that there is a small-scale mining and a quarry nearby, residents shouldn’t live there in the first place. People should settle and reside somewhere that are safer and not in a landslide prone area.
d. Landslides happen almost every year in the country, especially when there is heavy and continuous rainfall due to typhoon or monsoons. However, because of human induced activities such as mining and quarry operations, the aftermath worsen and it became more life threatening to the people residing in the area.</a>

                                            Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It means that we should stop dreaming of something we want to accomplish because it doesn't make a change or a progress. It remains a dream if you keep dreaming on it. Act, plan, and start doing things that could make that dream possible for you to achieve. Take small steps so you could know what to do later on your journey. With that,you can make your dreams come true.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yes. Hope this helps!

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

                            5. Respect Begets Respect By Ma. Melanie L. Padohinog Joseph is a smart boy who loves to learn almost everything. He always excels in class the reason why his teacher adores him. He does his best just to make his parents proud of him. He dreams of becoming a policeman just like his father. One day, Mrs. Pe, their English teacher, teaches them about "adjectives" in school. The whole class is enjoying their lesson. When Mrs. Pe asked the class to give examples of adjectives, John excitedly raised his hand. He said, "Fat, Ma'am. Joseph is fat. Ha! Ha! Ha!" The whole class laughed with him. Mrs. Pe told the class, "Children, will you please excuse me? John, please come with me outside for a while." When they are outside, Mrs. Pe said, "John, do you think what you did is good? You know, shaming someone is bad. It is not good to humiliate your classmate. What do you think is the best thing that you will do now?" John answered, "Ma'am, I am very sorry. I did not realize that it will hurt you and Joseph. Don't worry, Ma'am, I will ask for an apology from Kian." "All right then, it's okay. I'm happy you understood that teasing anybody is not good. You may go to Joseph now," said Mrs. Pe with a smile. John went back inside the classroom and talked to Kian. "I'm so sorry, Joseph. I know what I did was wrong and even if you did not say anything I feel that you were hurt. I promise I won't do it again," John said humbly. "It's okay, John. I accept your apology," Joseph said happily. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where and when does the story happen? 3. Why does Ms. Pe ask Romeo to apologize to Kian? 4. What point of view is used in narrating the story? 5. If you were Kian, how would Romeo's answer to Ms. Pe make you feel? Will you accept his apology? Why or why not? 6. What is the over-all message of the story for students like you?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The characters in the story are Joseph, Mrs. Pe (their English teacher), John (who teased Joseph), and Kian (Joseph's classmate).</p><p>2. The story happens in a school setting during an English class where Mrs. Pe teaches them about adjectives.</p><p>3. Ms. Pe asks John to apologize to Joseph because he hurt Joseph's feelings by teasing him in front of the class.</p><p>4. The story is narrated from the third person point of view.</p><p>5. If I were Kian, Romeo's answer to Ms. Pe would make me feel relieved and happy. I would accept his apology because he realized his mistake and showed genuine remorse for his actions.</p><p>6. The overall message of the story is that respect begets respect. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to apologize when we make mistakes. It also teaches us to be mindful of our words and actions, and to think before we speak or act.</p><br />

I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leaveHe was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose? This guy, this person who volunteered his time He got the job What was the difference between the two friends?

                        <p><strong>₊ଘ﹕Answer ⸝⸝</strong></p>c.   1. Erra is a good leader in the class. She believes that actions speak louder than words that's why she always succeeds in everything she does.c. It's easy to say things but difficult to act and follow through​."Actions speak louder than words" means that <strong>something you have said can only be totally confirmed if you've personally done/experienced it yourself</strong>. This saying is also similar to "Things are easier said than done."a.    2. My grandmother said to always put your best foot forward every time if you want to have a good future.a. Give your best every time."Always put your best foot forward" means that <strong>we must exert our efforts and choose the best thing to do in every situation</strong> we find ourselves in. The word "foot" is used because we commonly relate the decisions we make in life as "steps".a.    3. Miel is hardworking and has a strong faith in God. She believes that you should do your best and God will do the rest.a. To become successful, you must do your part and trust God."Do you best, and God will do the rest.", I don't think I can add more explanations since this saying is already obvious. But this basically means that <strong>we should work hard in every aspect of our lives, and when it gets rough or when you've reached your limits, you can depend on God to guide you.</strong>b.    4. Ashley is the noisiest in the class. Her classmates termed him an empty vessel that makes much noise because he ranked last in the class.b. People who know nothing are the most talkative"An empty vessel that makes much noise.", <strong>the empty vessel refers to someone that is loud.</strong> Usually, people who have insecurities with their knowledge tend to cover up and distract others from their imperfections by talking a lot.c.    5. Chelsea believes what you sow is what you reap depending on how much effort you exert on certain things.c. What you do is what you get; it depends on how good you or bad your action is."What you sow is what you reap." means that <strong>with every action you do, there is an equal reaction that will result from it</strong>.b.    6. Lara is an Aeta. She has no confidence to show her talent because of her physical appearance. Her teacher Jona reminds her that beauty is in the eye of the beholder so she does not have to worry about what others would say.b. What is beautiful to someone may be different from others."Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.", beauty is subjective. This saying means that <strong>people see things differently</strong>, everyone has different standards and preferences.b.    7. Flynn was a victim of gossips. Because of this, she finally had an anger outburst and whispered to those gossipers, "Curiosity killed the cat."b. It's dangerous meddling in the business of others.a.    8 Jazzy set goals ahead. She always looks at the future and sometimes oversees things that may happen to her when she becomes old. Her father told her to not cross a bridge until she comes to it.a. Just focus on the present situation and not worry too much about the things ahead."Do not cross a bridge until you come to it." means that <strong>we shouldn't let things in the future take up too much space in our minds</strong> that we forget the things happening in front of us in the present. Although planning and setting goals is a good thing to do, being too preoccupied with the future isn't.c.    9. For Rein, time is gold so he finishes his works on timec. Spend your time efficiently.a.   10. Gia is friendly, but she does not trust easily. She chooses her friends very carefully. She always keeps this mind, "Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are."a. Your friends' character may be reflected on you.<p>ʚ —————————————————— ɞ</p><p>     Best of luck, buttercup! ₍^･ω･^₎⟆</p><p>              #BrainliestBunch</p><br />

                            10. Read the story below and answer the questions that follow.Tower to the MoonCaribbean is a group of islands surrounded by waters. On one of those islands lived a king, who was ruthless. If he said he wanted something, he had to have it.One night, when he was looking out the window, he saw a moon in the color of silver and immediately said “I want to reach it.” A few days went by; he was thinking and thinking “How can I reach that silver moon?” Then it occurred to him “I need a tall tower to reach it.”Next day, he called a royal carpenter and said “I want you to build a tower so tall that it will reach the moon.” The carpenter knew that he shouldn’t be disagreeing with the king, but he pleaded “Your majesty, it is impossible. The tower will crumble before itreaches the moon.”“There is no such thing as impossible in this kingdom” shouted the king “I want you to come back tomorrow morning and give me your plan how you’re going to build the tower.” The carpenter knew not to say anything else, so he left.He knew how to make nice furniture, but he had no idea how to build such talltower. He thought and thought and then looking at his furniture said “I know I will pile up lots of wooden chests up to the sky.” The following day, the carpenter presented his idea to the king.“Great idea” said the king. He ordered his royal staff to search all the houses in the kingdom for strong chests. “If somebody refuses” said the king “Then remind them that if they don’t like to share the wooden chests, then they’ll be sharing a royal prison rooms.”Scared people wouldn’t refuse the king, so they handed their chests. Once all the chests were collected, a tower started growing outside the palace. It was a very unique and colorful tower filled with smaller and bigger chests, carved and painted chests. It was almost like a rainbow trying to reach the sky.Unfortunately, all the chests in the kingdom were not enough to reach the sky. So the king ordered the carpenter to make more chests. The carpenter got busy with making more chests and piling them up. Unfortunately, all the wood in the kingdom was not enough to reach the sky. So the king ordered the carpenter to cut all the trees. “Your majesty” pleaded the carpenter “We can’t cut all the trees.”“What do you mean we can’t” yelled the king “There is no such thing as can’t in this kingdom.” So the carpenter knew not to say anything else. He left to cut all the trees. He got busy with making more chests and piling them up. It seemed as the tower was reaching the sky. “It’s time to reach the moon” said the king and started climbing the tower made of chests.He reached the last chest, stood on his toes, stretched out his both arms and he almost touched the moon. “We need one more chest” shouted the king. “Your majesty we don’t have any more chests, any more wood or trees” pleaded the carpenter again. “Can’t you think of something or do I have to think for you” yelled the king “Just pull one chest from the bottom and bring it to the top.”The carpenter couldn’t believe what the king was saying. “If I pull a chest from the bottom, then the whole tower will crumble. He can’t be serious” thought the carpenter. “Did you hear me” hollered the king.“As you wish” answered the carpenter and he pulled the chest at the bottom. Do you know what happened to the king? He got lost among all those tumbling down chests and that was the end of him and his ruthless ruling.Questions:What was the king’s dream?_________________________________________________________________________________What did he ask the carpenter to do?_________________________________________________________________________________Was the carpenter able to do the task at once?

By Ma. Melanie L. Padohinog
Kian is a smart boy who loves to learn almost everything. He always
excels in class the reason why his teacher adores him. He does all his best just
to make his parents proud of him. He dreams of becoming a policeman just
like his father.
One day, in school, Mrs. Pe, their English teacher, is teaching them
about “adjectives”. The whole class is enjoying their lesson. When Mrs. Pe
asked the class to give examples of adjectives, Romeo excitedly raised his hand.
He said, “Fat, Ma’am. Kian is fat. Ha!Ha!Ha!” The whole class laughed with him.
Mrs. Pe told the class, “Children, will you please excuse me? Romeo, please
come with me outside for a while.”When they are outside, Mrs. Pe said, “Romeo, do you think what you did
is good? You know, shaming someone is bad. It is not good to humiliate your
classmate. What do you think is the best thing that you will do now?”
Romeo answered, “Ma’am, I am very sorry. I did not realize that it will
hurt you and Kian. Don’t worry, Ma’am, I will ask an apology from Kian.”
“All right then, it’s okay. I’m happy that you understood that it is not
good to tease anybody. You may go to Kian now,” said Mrs. Pe with a smile.
Romeo went back inside the classroom and talked to Kian.
“I’m so sorry, Kian. I know what I did was wrong and even if you did not
say anything I feel that you were hurt. I promise I won’t do it again,” Romeo
said humbly.
“It’s okay, Romeo. I accept your apology,” Kian said happily.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The characters in the story are Joseph, Mrs. Pe, John, and Kian (mentioned but not central to the plot).</p><p>2. The story happens in a school, during an English class where they were discussing adjectives.</p><p>3. Ms. Pe asks John to apologize to Joseph because he teased and humiliated him in class, which is not acceptable behavior.</p><p>4. The story is narrated in third person point of view.</p><p>5. As an AI language model, I cannot feel emotions. But if I were Kian, I might feel hesitant to accept John's apology at first, but it's good that he apologized and promised not to do it again, so I might accept his apology and move on.</p><p>6. The overall message of the story is that it's not okay to tease or humiliate others, and we should always treat our classmates with respect and kindness. It's important to apologize when we make mistakes and try to make things right.</p><p></p><br />

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.

                            21. 26. The following proves that humans have the capacity and ability to transcend despite the endless limitations that we have, EXCEPT one. *
a. It seems impossible to get rid of the corona virus because it is still invisible to everybody’s eyes and we can get infected by it anytime, anywhere.
b. It seems impossible for us humans to live on Mars, but NASA is continuously developing scientific expertise needed in order to equip humans to counter asteroids by the year 2025 and preparing space explorations bound for Mars by the year 2030.
c. It seems impossible to create our own sun because we are not simply the Creator (God). However, Chinese scientists have managed to create an artificial sun that could eventually be used as an inexhaustible source of power solving the world energy crisis.
d. It seems impossible to fly for we are not birds who have wings, but through intellect and will, the Wright Brothers were able to create the wright flyer of 1903 which was the first powered airplane to demonstrate sustainable flight under the full control of the pilot.
27. Which of the following situations supports this statement by Kaplan: “Hesitation marks the opening of possibility, attention marks the fixing of possibility, and choice marks the closing of possibility.” *
a. Anna Mae has given the opportunity to become an events host, for they were able to see the potential on her to be one someday. However, she doubted her skills and experiences for it’s her first time to become a host in a prestigious event. Because of it, she decided to decline the offer and wait for the perfect time that she will be ready.
b. Louie was appointed to become the project head of their company and he will be sent abroad. He became hesitant about it for he will be far away from his family, but then he realized that this has been his dream position ever since. So, he accepted the offer and believe in his self that he can do it.
c. Both A and B
d. None of the above
28. Floods, landslides, and wildfires are just of the many natural disasters that happens every year and in every part of the globe. However, as time passes by, these natural disasters became worse and caused detrimental effects to humans than ever before. With that, is there something we can do in order to prevent this? *
a. Yes. We can always pray to God and ask to stop these natural disasters to occur
b. No. Because as human beings, we don’t have any special powers to prevent something huge like natural disasters.
c. Yes. By eliminating human induced activities such as deforestation, illegal mining and quarrying, improper waste disposal and a lot more.
d. No. From the word itself, natural, so everything that happened inside our planet occurs naturally and we can’t really do something about it as humans.
29. Three years ago, on the same month of September, two massive landslides have occurred and devasted the town of Itogon in Benguet and the city of Naga in Cebu, which have claimed many lives and damage to properties. Both were triggered by their mountainsides getting soaked with water, however it was also aggravated by small-scale mining and a quarry near the landslide sites. With that, what is the best conclusion you can make from this phenomena? *
a. Landslides are naturally occurring disasters that are usually triggered by rainfalls brought by typhoons and monsoons. Since it happens naturally, we can’t really do something about it, but maybe evacuate, as soon as possible knowing that it is a landslide prone area.
b. There is mining and a quarry but it is not the sole reason why the landslides happen because during that time, the town of Itogon was affected by Typhoon Ompong(Mangkhut) and continuous rain in Naga City, Cebu brought by habagat or the southwest monsoon
c. Knowing that there is a small-scale mining and a quarry nearby, residents shouldn’t live there in the first place. People should settle and reside somewhere that are safer and not in a landslide prone area.
d. Landslides happen almost every year in the country, especially when there is heavy and continuous rainfall due to typhoon or monsoons. However, because of human induced activities such as mining and quarry operations, the aftermath worsen and it became more life threatening to the people residing in the area.</h2><br />

                            26. Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph
