                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Direct speech
</p><p>Direct speech can be used in virtually every tense in English. You can use it to describe something in the present tense – to express something that is happening in the present moment, or make it feel like it is happening right now.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>“While she’s on the phone, she’s saying to him, “I’m never going to talk to you again.”
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also use direct speech in the past and future tenses. You’ll often come across direct speech in the past tense to describe something that has already happened. Most written forms of English will use direct speech in this way.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>“He said to her, “I’ll catch the last train home.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Direct speech can be used in the future tense too, to create a feeling of anticipation, or expectation. It can also be used to express something that you plan to say to someone.
</p><p>
</p><p>While you might not come across this in formal or professional forms of written English, you will probably see this commonly in creative forms of writing, such as a story or novel.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>Before I go away I’ll tell him, “I’m never coming back.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Direct speech isn’t always a description of what someone may have spoken. You can also quote from other texts in a similar way, by using inverted commas before and after the quote. Here, instead of using the verb “to say”, you might want to use a different verb instead, such as “to write”, “to state” or “to describe”.
</p><p>
</p><p>Indirect speech
</p><p>Indirect speech is used to report what someone may have said, and so it is always used in the past tense. Instead of using inverted commas, we can show that someone’s speech is being described by using the word “that” to introduce the statement first.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>“She said that she was not hungry.”
</p><p>
</p><p>You can use different verbs to express what is being reported – while “to say” is quite commonly used, you might also want to use “to tell”, to describe something that has been told to you.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>“He told me that he didn’t have enough money.”</p><p></p><p>NOTE: OBJECTIVES ARE NOT QUESTIONS, THEREFORE THIS IS SOMETHING NOT TO BE ANSWERED. IN ADDITION, I EXPLAINED THE TOPIC FURTHER FOR YOUR GUIDE.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST!</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Direct speech represents the exact words used by another person. Because another person's words are being shared, quotation marks are required when using direct speech. By contrast, reported speech communicates the idea behind what a person said without using his or her exact words. Direct speech: “I had a headache yesterday.” Indirect speech: You said you'd had a headache the day before yesterday. Direct speech: “It's been raining since this afternoon.” Indirect speech: He said it'd been raining since that afternoon.To convert direct speech to reported speech, we must change all the present tenses in the direct speech to the corresponding past tenses in the reported speech. Example: Fiona said, "You are late." - Fiona said that I was late.</p><br />
