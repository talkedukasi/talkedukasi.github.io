But for Lloyd, Alice can also be considered as an ideal role model for any society simultaneously (Criticism of 'Alice'. Accessed August 17, 2020). ___________ 9.

Happiness must be something solid and permanent, without fear and without uncertainty." He simply recounts the story of a prince 'who escapes from the valley of happiness,' to search for perpetual bliss. However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10.

Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.

Study The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. This book takes place in the American South in the 19th century and follows a white boy, Huck, as he helps a black slave, Jim, escape his situation. Here we've got quite a bit more detail. Instead of just two large classes, society is divided into several smaller ones (Study.com. Accessed August 28, 2020).__________ 8. Judith Little and Megan S. Lloyd argue that Alice is a "literally underground image of a woman" battling the "system." Still, they also view Alice's insistence, activity, and curiosity as typically "Un-Victorian" traits that make her an example of a seditious woman. But for Lloyd, Alice can also be considered as an ideal role model for any society simultaneously (Criticism of 'Alice'. Accessed August 17, 2020).___________ 9. Samuel Johnson once stressed in his novel entitled, The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia the following words: "I have here the world before me; I will review it at leisure: surely happiness is somewhere to be found... Happiness must be something solid and permanent, without fear and without uncertainty." He simply recounts the story of a prince 'who escapes from the valley of happiness,' to search for perpetual bliss. However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10. Through Phoenix's strenuous journey in the wild country of Natchez Trace, Eudora Welty uses her protagonist to symbolically show the struggle of African-Americans toward equality and integration in the South after the Civil War (Writing a Formalist Literary Analysis.

Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.
