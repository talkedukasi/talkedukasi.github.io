                            24. SAD LITTLE HOUSES Amparo R. Asuncion The sad little houses, the poor little houses  Crowd by the riverside The holes in their roofs,the cracks in their walls   Vainly they tried to hide. The stench of the river, the dark muddy river Is with them night and day Pure, fresh air may be had for the moving, But they can’t move away.   They can only stand by the bank of the river Buried knee-deep in clay, They can only stare at the drifting garbage Until they, too, decay.And, pass away into ghosts of houses Killed by a burning sun, Smothered with dust And then forgotten – forgotten by everyone.21-25. How does the quthor feel as suggested in his lines in the poem?(Write 2 to 3 sentences.)26-30. How will you explain this “Poverty became a disease in countries like in the Philippines”. (Write 2 to 3 sentences.)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>21-25. The author feels a sense of sadness and pity for the little houses that are trapped by the riverside, unable to escape the poverty and degradation that surrounds them. The use of phrases like "vainly they tried to hide" and "they can only stare at the drifting garbage" suggests a feeling of hopelessness and despair.</p><p></p><p>26-30. "Poverty became a disease in countries like in the Philippines" means that poverty has become a chronic and widespread problem in these countries, with deep roots and far-reaching effects that are difficult to overcome. Like a disease, it spreads and infects individuals and communities, affecting their health, well-being, and opportunities for growth and development. This may be due to a variety of factors, including economic inequality, lack of access to education and resources, and systemic barriers to social mobility.</p><br />
