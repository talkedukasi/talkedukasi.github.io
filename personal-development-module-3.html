If you are in their position, whatndAs discussed in the previous module, Personality refers to how an individualuniquely thinks feels and behaves in different situations. As we look back, beloware some questions to ponder. Answer the following questions on the spaceprovided1. How do you know your personality?2. Why is it important to know yourself better? What are the things you want todevelop and improve within yourself?Spin3. Is there importance in understanding and studying yourself, especially when youfeel helpless and quarantine in your own home? Cite some reasons.the low do you feel for those who early give up in life such as news about suicide,will you do? Explain your answer​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. I know my personality well, I've been in a different battles already and I can say that I already know myself better as before. I actually a stronger and wiser now. </p><p>The starting point of knowing yourself is to know yourself is by looking up to your ideals, desires, where you're good and bad at and the lessons of life that has given to you.</p><p>2. It's essential to know yourself better for you not to be mislead. Always remember that where ever you go and whatever difficulties you go through the only one that will help you to conquer those things is you, yourself.</p><p>3. Yes, there's an importance in understanding yourself especially now that we're at home only. At this point of time, we are prone on being on depress and stress for so many reasons. There are instances that you feel so empty and unworthy and don't even know what to do. It seems that you're starting to lose yourself and i interest to those things that excites you before and catches your attention. </p><p>When you understand yourself then you can make right actions or right decisions giving you an overflowing satisfaction. </p><p>4. Seeing and hearing such news about suicidal cases makes my heart breaks. It's so hard knowing that another person commits suicide, though we don't know what's the real story behind but it's still not the right thing to do. If you are experiencing anxiety and depression, don't keep at into yourself only. Try to share it to someone who you think is worthy of sharing for. Or if you have trust issues and got ignored by people whom you expect to open up to, you can share it with God. Just pray and tell him your grudges. Taking your own life is not a solution, don't end it just because you are tired of your life. Rather, be strong and keep on fighting. Things happens for a reason and for a purpose. Don't waste your precious life, as long as you are living always make the most of it and live your life to the fullest. Problems are just temporary but death is permanently. You can't bring back the life that was taken already. So, think first before doing an action so that you will not regret it in the end. </p><p></p><p>To someone who's reading this and feels like his/her life is miserable, take my advice that sooner or later you'll ge fine. The pain or sadness that you're experiencing right now will not last long and wouldn't bother you, soon! You can do it, you can surpass it all. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:1. Narrative text (Topic: An Adventure Story)  &gt; At April 29, 2021, My friend celebrated his 16th birthday, he invited me over and my other friends to eat food and watch movies for his birthday. And so before I went to the party, I went to the National book store to at least buy him a simple gift, and so I bought  happy birthday card for him and I also bought a confetti so that me and my friends can surprise him at his birthday. When we came to his birthday he was so shocked because we played song that made him cringe and popped the confetti right after his face. After celebrating his special day, his mom gave us some food so that we can bring them home and eat them whenever we are hungry, then we all greeted him for the last time and went home.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Explanatory text (Topic: Water Cycle)</strong></p><p><strong> &gt;The water cycle is powered by the sun's energy and gravity. The sun kickstarts the whole cycle by heating all the Earth's water and making it evaporate. Gravity makes the moisture fall back to Earth.There are four main stages in the water cycle. They are evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection. Let's look at each of these stages. </strong></p><p><strong> Evaporation: This is when warmth from the sun causes water from oceans, lakes, streams, ice and soils to rise into the air and turn into water vapour (gas). Water vapour droplets join together to make clouds!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Condensation: : This is when water vapor in the air cools down and turns back into liquid water.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Precipitation:  This is when water (in the form of rain, snow, hail or sleet) falls from clouds in the sky.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Collection: This is when water that falls from the clouds as rain, snow, hail or sleet, collects in the oceans, rivers, lakes, streams. Most will infiltrate (soak into) the ground and will collect as underground water.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The water cycle is powered by the sun's energy and gravity.

Factual and Personal Recounts (Topic: Favorite Holiday Memory)  &gt; My favorite holiday memory is having Christmas at my grandparents house, because me and my cousin had so much fun playing all night long playing tag and playing video games, we also shared our memories together we also told each other our secrets and our crushes, we even gave each other gifts. We stayed at our grandmas house for 1 week and it was the best holiday ever!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4.Persuasive text (Topic: Keeping Yourself Healthy)  &gt;Staying healthy physically can help you stay healthy emotionally too. If you're eating the right food and keeping fit, your body will be strong and help you to cope with stress and also fight illness. Eating well and exercising often when you're a teenager will also help you stay in good health later in life. So start eating more vegetables, fruits and also take vitamins to maintain your strong body. also stop doing your bad habits if you have one, like for examples drinking, smoking, doing drugs, etc. stop it! so that you can start a healthy life style and live long.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5. Expository Text (Topic: Three Reasons Why Learners should Use Modules)  &gt;Because   1.) it provides an aid in the presentation and application of the online teaching and learning process.  2.) The majority of students  rely on the lecture notes, reference and text books study materials at large to maintain good performance in their studies.  3.) Research findings show that course module is useful academically up to some level in improving the standards of students.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>~Narrative text- (narrative) a spoken or written account of connected events; a story.</p><p>~Explanatory text- serving to explain something.</p><p>~Factual and Personal Recounts</p><p>&gt;A factual recount is an objective recount of a true event by someone not personally involved in the situation.
