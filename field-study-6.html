The field of environmental science can be divided into three main goals, which are to learn how the natural world works, to understand how we as humans interact with the environment, and also to determine how we affect the environment. The third goal of determining how humans affect the environment also includes finding ways to deal with these effects on the environment.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Before the invention of telescopes, astronomers were limited in their ability to observe and study astronomical phenomena. Without the aid of telescopes, they were limited to observing celestial objects with the naked eye, which limited their ability to discern details and make accurate measurements.</p><p></p><p>For example, without telescopes, astronomers were unable to observe the moons of Jupiter or the rings of Saturn, two important discoveries made possible by the use of telescopes. Without telescopes, they were also unable to observe distant galaxies, which has greatly expanded our understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The invention of telescopes revolutionized the field of astronomy by allowing astronomers to observe celestial objects and phenomena in much greater detail and with much greater accuracy. This led to many important discoveries, such as the discovery of new planets, the first measurement of the speed of light, and the realization that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The use of telescopes also allowed astronomers to make more accurate measurements of the positions, sizes, and distances of celestial objects, which has led to a more precise understanding of the universe. In addition, telescopes have allowed astronomers to study the electromagnetic spectrum in detail, which has led to many important discoveries in fields such as astrophysics and cosmology.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) A Forensic Scientist analyzes physical evidence collected from a crime scene, while a Forensic Pathologist examines the bodies of the deceased to determine cause of death.</p><p>2) Forensic Toxicology studies the presence and effects of drugs, chemicals, and poisons in the body. Examples include testing for alcohol in blood samples, detecting illegal drugs in urine samples, and analyzing the effects of prescription medication on an individual's behavior.</p><p>3) Forensic Odontology studies dental evidence in criminal investigations. Examples include identifying bite marks on a victim, comparing dental records to unidentified remains, and analyzing bite marks on food or other objects found at a crime scene.</p><p>4) Six examples of trace evidence are hair, fibers, fingerprints, DNA, gunshot residue, and footprints.</p><p>5) Ballistics studies firearms and ammunition to determine their origin and use in a crime. Examples include analyzing bullet trajectory, identifying weapons used in drive-by shootings, examining bullet casings to match them to a specific firearm, and analyzing gunshot wounds to determine the distance between the victim and the shooter.</p><p>6) The responsibilities of a coroner may include determining cause and manner of death, identifying the deceased, maintaining records and reports, notifying next of kin, and conducting autopsies.</p><p>7) A Coroner is an elected official who may not have a medical background, while a Medical Examiner is a licensed physician who specializes in forensic pathology.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1    The Problem Can Be Stated Clearly and Concisely</p><p></p><p>Unless the problem can be stated clearly and concisely it is probably a poor problem or a non-problem. The best way to test the problem statement is to write it into a concise sentence or paragraph and to share it with others. If the problem cannot be stated in a clear paragraph it has difficulties and will not endure as a suitable problem. Of course, it is not easy to express complex issues in simplistic terms and it may take many weeks and countless drafts before the statement is satisfactory. Good critics are essential. If your spouse or mother cannot understand it, it is probably flaky.</p><p></p><p>2    The Problem Generates Research Questions</p><p></p><p>The problem should generate a number of more specific research questions. These turn the problem into a question format and represent various aspects or components of the problem. The research questions make the more general statement easier to address and provide a framework for the research. Formulating these questions can be a challenge, particularly specifying them at the right level of abstraction.</p><p></p><p>3    It Is Grounded in Theory</p><p></p><p>Good problems have theoretical and/or conceptual frameworks for their analysis. They relate the specifics of what is being investigated to a more general background of theory which helps interpret the results and link it to the field.</p><p></p><p>4    It Relates to One or More Academic Fields of Study</p><p></p><p>Good problems relate to academic fields which have adherents and boundaries. They typically have journals to which adherents relate. Research problems which do not have clear links to one or two such fields of study are generally in trouble. Without such a field it becomes impossible to determine where, in the universe of knowledge, the problem lies.</p><p></p><p>5    It Has a Base in the Research Literature</p><p></p><p>Related to the former points, a well-stated problem will relate to a research literature. Tight problems often relate to a well-defined body of literature, written by a select group of researchers and published in a small number of journals. With some problems, it might at first be difficult to establish the connections and literature base, but there should be a base somewhere.</p><p></p><p>6    It Has Potential Significance/importance</p><p></p><p>This is the important ‘so what’ question: Who cares once you solve the problem? Assume that you have solved the problem and answered the questions and then ask yourself if you are any further ahead. At the very least, the problem must have importance to the researcher, but ideally it should also be of consequence to others.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
