• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

                                            Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</a>

No face-to-face classes until Covid-19 vaccine is available (By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz June 8, 2020, 2:09 pm) MANILA – Students will remain at home indefinitely after the Department of Education (DepEd) announced its compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte’s order to suspend face-to-face classes until a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is available. In a statement, DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones thanked Duterte for supporting DepEd’s endeavor to offer alternative learning methods in light of the public health situation caused by the disease. While preparing schools for “a different setup” is a challenge, she said DepEd is readying the resumption of school operations based on their Basic Education — Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) which would affect almost the entire education infrastructure in the country — from the DepEd Central Office down to the school level. “We are updating our policies, realigning our finances, and collaborating with our partners so that our goals of providing quality education and protecting the safety and health of our constituents will be achieved,” Briones said. Remote enrollment is ongoing nationwide with the aim of collecting and assessing household information of students. The enrollment will be crucial in preparing and tailor-fitting the learning delivery method in different localities, Briones said. Meanwhile, the groundwork for “blended learning” is underway, which would make use of radio, television, online, and modular learning — currently being prepared and updated by the DepEd this year. “At the same time, teachers are being trained on utilizing newer platforms and innovative tools to aid their professional development,” Briones said. To ensure the effectiveness of these alternative learning methods, she said the DepEd is working with the private sector and education experts to make the necessary steps “logically sound, especially on the development, acquisition and deployment of learning resources.” For the duration of its implementation of the BE-LCP, she said the DepEd would provide regular assessment reports to the public which it previously committed to the House of Representatives. Last week, the DepEd announced that a total of 5,204,949 students have enrolled in both public and private schools nationwide during the first week of its remote enrollment system. The enrollment, which is for school year 2020-2021, is done through the phone or through online platforms and will last until June 30. (PNA) ​</a>

• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

                            7. Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</h2><br />

No face-to-face classes until Covid-19 vaccine is available (By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz June 8, 2020, 2:09 pm) MANILA – Students will remain at home indefinitely after the Department of Education (DepEd) announced its compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte’s order to suspend face-to-face classes until a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is available. In a statement, DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones thanked Duterte for supporting DepEd’s endeavor to offer alternative learning methods in light of the public health situation caused by the disease. While preparing schools for “a different setup” is a challenge, she said DepEd is readying the resumption of school operations based on their Basic Education — Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) which would affect almost the entire education infrastructure in the country — from the DepEd Central Office down to the school level. “We are updating our policies, realigning our finances, and collaborating with our partners so that our goals of providing quality education and protecting the safety and health of our constituents will be achieved,” Briones said. Remote enrollment is ongoing nationwide with the aim of collecting and assessing household information of students. The enrollment will be crucial in preparing and tailor-fitting the learning delivery method in different localities, Briones said. Meanwhile, the groundwork for “blended learning” is underway, which would make use of radio, television, online, and modular learning — currently being prepared and updated by the DepEd this year. “At the same time, teachers are being trained on utilizing newer platforms and innovative tools to aid their professional development,” Briones said. To ensure the effectiveness of these alternative learning methods, she said the DepEd is working with the private sector and education experts to make the necessary steps “logically sound, especially on the development, acquisition and deployment of learning resources.” For the duration of its implementation of the BE-LCP, she said the DepEd would provide regular assessment reports to the public which it previously committed to the House of Representatives. Last week, the DepEd announced that a total of 5,204,949 students have enrolled in both public and private schools nationwide during the first week of its remote enrollment system. The enrollment, which is for school year 2020-2021, is done through the phone or through online platforms and will last until June 30. (PNA) ​</h2><br />
