                                            I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</a>

                                            The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</a>

                            7. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</h2><br />

                            9. The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</h2><br />
