                                            What I Have Learned
1. Society was brought by the human desire to relate with others. It is considered a product of deliberate actions by individuals who come together in pursuit of a common goal.
2. Society greatly influences the individual, as it determines to a certain extent a person’s identity. Society makes possible the emergence of certain individualities, which are the result of the person’s interaction with other members of society.
3. Philosophers consider society as a product of the “social contract”, where individuals decide to sacrifice personal interest and submit to a higher authority. Society is also rooted in the concepts of the common good and general welfare, which refers to social conditions that enable persons and groups to fulfill their goals and achieve well-being.

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                            14. What I Have Learned
1. Society was brought by the human desire to relate with others. It is considered a product of deliberate actions by individuals who come together in pursuit of a common goal.
2. Society greatly influences the individual, as it determines to a certain extent a person’s identity. Society makes possible the emergence of certain individualities, which are the result of the person’s interaction with other members of society.
3. Philosophers consider society as a product of the “social contract”, where individuals decide to sacrifice personal interest and submit to a higher authority. Society is also rooted in the concepts of the common good and general welfare, which refers to social conditions that enable persons and groups to fulfill their goals and achieve well-being.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The general objectives of privatization of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) are to reduce the size of government, increase efficiency, and generate revenue for the government. Privatization can also be used as a way to introduce competition into industries that were previously monopolized by the government.</p><p></p><p>2. Some limits of privatization include the potential for increased costs for goods and services, reduced access to essential goods and services for low-income individuals, and the potential for private companies to prioritize profit over social welfare. There may also be concerns about the potential for corruption and lack of accountability in the privatization process.</p><p></p><p>3. Privatization is not necessarily the answer to government inefficiencies. It may be one option among many for addressing inefficiencies, but it is important to carefully consider the potential costs and benefits of privatization before making a decision.</p><p></p><p>4. It is difficult to give a blanket approval or disapproval of the privatization of GOCCs. The decision to privatize a particular GOCC should be based on a careful analysis of the specific circumstances and potential impacts on society. In some cases, privatization may be a beneficial choice, while in other cases it may not be the best option.</p><p></p><p>Political parties differ from other groups, such as interest groups, civil society organizations, and social movements, in several ways. Political parties are typically organized around a specific ideology or set of principles and seek to influence government policy through the election of their members to public office. Interest groups are organizations that seek to influence policy on specific issues, but do not typically seek to elect their members to public office. Civil society organizations are non-governmental organizations that work to promote the interests of a particular community or cause. Social movements are large, informal groups that seek to bring about social or political change through collective action.</p><p>1. The general objectives of privatization of government owned and controlled corporations include reducing the size and financial burden of the government, increasing efficiency and profitability of the corporations, and potentially generating revenue for the government through the sale of state assets.</p><p></p><p>2. The limits of privatization include the potential loss of control and accountability over the services or resources being provided, the potential for increased costs for the users of the services or resources, and the potential for negative social and economic impacts on certain groups.</p><p></p><p>3. It is not necessarily the case that privatization is the answer to government inefficiencies. While privatization can potentially lead to increased efficiency in some cases, it may also introduce new challenges and problems. It is important to carefully consider the potential costs and benefits of privatization in each specific context.</p><p></p><p>4. Whether or not to approve of the privatization of corporations depends on the specific circumstances and the potential costs and benefits. It is important to carefully evaluate the potential impacts on the government, the corporations and the general public before deciding whether or not to pursue privatization[tex].[/tex]</p><p></p><br />

                            19. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I will agree with this, considering that religion plays a significant role in human society and culture. It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>.. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Necessity, cooperation and agreement make society possible.</p><p></p><p>For hundreds of thousands of years, humans lived in small semi-nomadic tribal groups, bound together by bonds of blood. Once agriculture took hold as common practice—between eight and twelve thousand years ago—populations became localized, bound by ties to a particular bit of turf.</p><p></p><p>Populations with reliable food supplies grew;</p><p>More demands were placed on the same amount of turf;</p><p>Hence, frictions arose. How can we all just get along?</p><p>Humans fashioned new forms of society to accommodate new exigent circumstances. The better societies did so through cooperation and agreement; the worse achieved compliance by force.</p><p></p><p>This one is by Nick Curtis</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
