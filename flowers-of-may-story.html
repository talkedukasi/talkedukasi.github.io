Although he was powerful, he was helpless when it came to winning the love of his young bride, Madayaw-Bayho (daughter of Tageb, king of the pirates).Barom-Mai asked his advisers to help him win his bride's love, and Matigam(the wisest of advisers) told him about Impit Purek, a hermit who lived in a cave inMt. Apo.They went to the hermit and he asked for three things: the egg of the black tabon bird, twelve ladles of fresh milk from a white carabao without blemish, and the nectar from the flower of the tree-of-make-believe.The egg will be used to soften the bride's heart; the milk, to make her kind; and, the nectar, to make her see Barom-Mai as a young and handsome king.The king finds the egg through the help of Pawikan, the king of the seaturtles. He luckily gets milk from a white carabao the following breakfast, thanks tohis cook. Hangin-Bai, the nymph of the air, leads him to her sister, the woodnymph who had the magic flower in her hair.Barom-Mai gives the three things to Impit Purok, who asked him to prepare a big feast after Barom Mai wins his queen back, and to invite Impit Purok as the king's guest of honor.Impit Purok mixes the three ingredients and instructs Barom-Mai to plant the mixture in the royal garden. The morning after it was planted, a tree grew. It had a sweet smell and its fruit tasted good. When Madayaw-Bayho was given the fruit, she fell in love with Barom-Mai.The king throws a big feast but forgets to invite Impit Purok. In retaliation, Impit casts a curse upon the fruit: The sweet smell was replaced with a foul odor while the smooth skin of the fruit was covered with thorns, which is how the durian smells and looks today.​</a>

                            26. important lines/dialogue and other literary devices cited  in the story of the first durian pls pa sagot Naman Po Ako sa nakaka alam THE STORY OF THE FIRST DURIAN (The Hermit's Three Wishes)Barom-Mai was an old and ugly king who lived in a kingdom called Calinan in the Visayas hundreds of years ago. Although he was powerful, he was helpless when it came to winning the love of his young bride, Madayaw-Bayho (daughter of Tageb, king of the pirates).Barom-Mai asked his advisers to help him win his bride's love, and Matigam(the wisest of advisers) told him about Impit Purek, a hermit who lived in a cave inMt. Apo.They went to the hermit and he asked for three things: the egg of the black tabon bird, twelve ladles of fresh milk from a white carabao without blemish, and the nectar from the flower of the tree-of-make-believe.The egg will be used to soften the bride's heart; the milk, to make her kind; and, the nectar, to make her see Barom-Mai as a young and handsome king.The king finds the egg through the help of Pawikan, the king of the seaturtles. He luckily gets milk from a white carabao the following breakfast, thanks tohis cook. Hangin-Bai, the nymph of the air, leads him to her sister, the woodnymph who had the magic flower in her hair.Barom-Mai gives the three things to Impit Purok, who asked him to prepare a big feast after Barom Mai wins his queen back, and to invite Impit Purok as the king's guest of honor.Impit Purok mixes the three ingredients and instructs Barom-Mai to plant the mixture in the royal garden. The morning after it was planted, a tree grew. It had a sweet smell and its fruit tasted good. When Madayaw-Bayho was given the fruit, she fell in love with Barom-Mai.The king throws a big feast but forgets to invite Impit Purok. In retaliation, Impit casts a curse upon the fruit: The sweet smell was replaced with a foul odor while the smooth skin of the fruit was covered with thorns, which is how the durian smells and looks today.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The important lines/dialogue and other literary devices cited in the story of the first durian includes Barom-Mai's plea to the hermit Impit Purek, "Help me win my bride's love", Matigam's advice regarding the hermit, "He will know what you must do", and Impit Purek's three requests: the egg of the black tabon bird, twelve ladles of fresh milk from a white carabao without blemish, and the nectar from the flower of the tree-of-make-believe. Other literary devices that are used in the story are metaphor, imagery and symbolism. For example, the egg symbolizes softening the bride's heart, the milk symbolizes making her kind, and the nectar symbolizes making her see Barom-Mai as a young and handsome king.</p>Durian is from philipines and i am writing this to have 10 points<br />
