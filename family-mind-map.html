                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Consider how each job aligns with your long-term career goals
</p><p>
</p><p>When you’re interviewing for a job, you want to prove you’re the best person for the role and that the organization can’t live without you. Once you have two job offers on the table, though, it’s time to consider how these job prospects align with your career goals.
</p><p>
</p><p>Instead of focusing on what you can do for the company, consider what each company can do for you. Go over everything you learned about the job, organization and culture during the interview process.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then, ask yourself the following questions:
</p><p>
</p><p>Which job still lines up with my career goals?
</p><p>
</p><p>Does one job have more opportunities for growth than the other?
</p><p>
</p><p>Which job will challenge me?
</p><p>
</p><p>Which job offers me the chance to learn new skills?
</p><p>
</p><p>If you’re having trouble deciding between two jobs, consider both through the lens of your long-term goals. Consider which position holds the most promise, and choose the one that will get you where you want to go.
</p><p>
</p><p>Weigh salary with personal satisfaction
</p><p>
</p><p>When choosing between two jobs, an easy question comes to mind: Which one pays more?
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, salary isn’t the only important factor. Personal satisfaction is also paramount. So what happens if the job you don’t really want pays a lot more than the one you do?
</p><p>
</p><p>If this is the case, you’ll need to weigh whether a higher salary will make up for a job you don’t like. Sure, you’ll have more money to spend outside of work. But if you’re bored 40 or more hours per week, a higher salary might not boost your happiness much.
</p><p>
</p><p>“My first job decision was between a financial consulting firm and an online education company,” said Augustin Kennady, media relations director for ShipMonk. “While it offered less money, the online education company was the right decision at the time. It also gave me the skills I needed to succeed in my next position.
</p><p>
</p><p>“I strongly recommend that you decide on your job not necessarily for the money, but for how closely the offer aligns with your values,” he added.
</p><p>
</p><p>You also might try negotiating for more money. Practice your salary negotiation tactics, and find out if you can increase your earnings or snag better benefits.
</p><p>
</p><p>If one position’s pay is so low you won’t be able to support yourself, you should probably go with the other one. But if both salaries meet your needs, you might be better off choosing a more fulfilling job.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>"You are offered two jobs by two different companies: One is a high paying job with long hours and better prospects but would give you little time with family and friends.
