                            1. what are the Impact of Social and Cultural Change in Philippine Society</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The impact of Christianity, on life in the Philippines was not only spiritual. It was a powerful vehicle of social and economic change. The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith. The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869. The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Policy reforms pursued by the Philippines over an extended period have resulted in a more open, competitive economy which was able to withstand relatively unscathed the Asian financial crisis. A new WTO report on the trade policies of the Philippines concludes that this provides a generally good example of the advantages of structural reform in overcoming macroeconomic shocks. The report also suggests that the Philippines could derive further benefits, including for its consumers, from more outward oriented, as opposed to an export-oriented trade and investment regimes.</p><br />
