Qualitative research designs are good at answering ‘How’ and ‘What’ questions.1.    Ethnography requires a researcher to have an immersion to the community.2.    Case study looks comprehensively on the participant’s behavior.3.    To understand the existing phenomenon in a certain place, ethnographic study will be done.4.        A grounded theory design aims to formulate a new theory or to modify the existing theory.5.        A case study requires a huge number of participants.6.        A narrative inquiry discovers the insights of the participants.7.        To better identify the effects of social media to the teenagers, a phenomenological study should be employed.8.        Ethnographic study limits the researchers to an interview with the participants only.9.        To contribute to the theories about a certain discipline, a grounded theory should be used.​</a>

Reaction paper, review, and critique ore simply summaries of books or article read. 10 Writing a reaction paper review and critique involves critical thinking and recognizing arguments. 11. The thesis statement can be found in the conclusion section of the reaction paper. 12. Major findings, claims. Ideos or messages are found in the review critique section of the reaction paper/review/critique. 13. Theoretical soundness and coherence of ideas are information which can be found in the introduction section 14. A counter argument can go anywhere except the conclusion 15. One of the most effective ways to rebut a counter argument is to show that it is based on faulty assumptions. paki sagot please​</a>

                        ➛Question:<p>why photoelectric effect is limitation of electromagnetic wave theory </p><p></p>Answer:<p>The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, such as light. This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, and it was later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. According to classical electromagnetic wave theory, the energy of a wave is proportional to its amplitude ( the height of the wave). Therefore, if a wave with sufficient energy is directed at a material, it should be able to eject electrons from the material. However, experiments showed that the photoelectric effect only occurred when the frequency (color) of the incident radiation was above a certain threshold, regardless of its amplitude. This was a challenge to the classical wave theory, which predicted that the intensity of the radiation (which is proportional to the amplitude) should be the determining factor for the photoelectric effect. </p><p></p><br />

                            3. Why photoelectric effect is limitation of electromagnetic wave theory ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: BRAINLIEST ME</strong></p><p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material surface when light is shone on it. The electromagnetic wave theory predicts that the intensity of the light should determine the energy of the emitted electrons, and that there should be a time delay between the light shining on the material and the emission of electrons. However, observations of the photoelectric effect showed that the number of electrons emitted depended on the frequency of the light, and that there was no time delay between the light shining on the material and the emission of electrons.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This contradicted the electromagnetic wave theory, which predicted that the intensity of the light, not its frequency, should determine the energy of the emitted electrons. As a result, a new theory was developed to explain the photoelectric effect, which led to the development of quantum mechanics.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, <strong>the photoelectric effect is a limitation of the electromagnetic wave theory because it cannot explain the observed phenomena related to the interaction of light and matter.</strong></p><br />
