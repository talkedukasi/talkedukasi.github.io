                                            Activity 2: MY Resources!Materials: Article about energy resources in the PhilippinesProcedures:1. Read and analyze carefully the article about the energy resources in our country.The abundance of some metal resources in the Philippines is related to geologic structures,specifically the presence of volcanoes and trenches in the country. Solar energy is free andinexhaustible. Isla Verde use solar energy. Heat from the ground (geothermal energy), ThePhilippines ranked second to the United States in terms of geothermal energy deposits.Geothermal power plants are located in Banahaw Makiling, Laguna, Tiwi in Albay, Bacman inSorsogon, Palimpinon in Negros Occidental, Tongonan in Leyte, and Mt. Apo side of Cotabato.Hydrothermal or hydroelectric power plants use water to generate electricity. Ambuklao inBenguet, Mt Province, Agus in Lanao del Sur and Agus in Lanao del Norte are large hydrothermalpower plants. Natural gas is a form of fossil fuel, so are coal and crude oil (sometimes calledpetroleum). Fossil fuels were formed from plants and animals that lived on Earth millions of yearsago. Coal deposits are scattered over the Philippines but the largest depasit is located in SemiraraIsland Antique. In Quirino, Ilocos Sur the electricity generated from wind mills runs a motorizedsugarcane press for the community's muscovado sugar production. Wind energy generateselectricity. Renewable resources are those which can be replaced naturally or through humanassisted actions within a relatively short amount of time. Nonrenewable resources are thoseavailable in limited amounts and take million of years to be replaced thus, people can rely only onthose deposits already in existence.2.

                            8. Activity 2: MY Resources!Materials: Article about energy resources in the PhilippinesProcedures:1. Read and analyze carefully the article about the energy resources in our country.The abundance of some metal resources in the Philippines is related to geologic structures,specifically the presence of volcanoes and trenches in the country. Solar energy is free andinexhaustible. Isla Verde use solar energy. Heat from the ground (geothermal energy), ThePhilippines ranked second to the United States in terms of geothermal energy deposits.Geothermal power plants are located in Banahaw Makiling, Laguna, Tiwi in Albay, Bacman inSorsogon, Palimpinon in Negros Occidental, Tongonan in Leyte, and Mt. Apo side of Cotabato.Hydrothermal or hydroelectric power plants use water to generate electricity. Ambuklao inBenguet, Mt Province, Agus in Lanao del Sur and Agus in Lanao del Norte are large hydrothermalpower plants. Natural gas is a form of fossil fuel, so are coal and crude oil (sometimes calledpetroleum). Fossil fuels were formed from plants and animals that lived on Earth millions of yearsago. Coal deposits are scattered over the Philippines but the largest depasit is located in SemiraraIsland Antique. In Quirino, Ilocos Sur the electricity generated from wind mills runs a motorizedsugarcane press for the community's muscovado sugar production. Wind energy generateselectricity. Renewable resources are those which can be replaced naturally or through humanassisted actions within a relatively short amount of time. Nonrenewable resources are thoseavailable in limited amounts and take million of years to be replaced thus, people can rely only onthose deposits already in existence.2.
