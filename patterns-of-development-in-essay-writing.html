Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.<br />

                            3. what are the different pattern of development in writing paragraphs or essays?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In addition to the concept of the thesis indicating a general, logical order for the support, there are actually many different ways to think about and organize information in the body of an essay, using different patterns of development. These patterns, referred to academically as “rhetorical modes,” mirror the ways in which humans think about their worlds and organize their thoughts in order to communicate.</p><p></p><p>The concept of rhetorical modes actually goes back to ancient civilizations. Though it seems particularly pressing in our current social media, online-all-the-time culture, the idea of “information overload” has troubled humans for centuries. Despite these concerns, many of our ancestors found productive ways to manage information overload. And their strategies remain helpful today. Ancient rhetoricians, including Aristotle and Cicero, developed techniques that writers used to gather, categorize, and explore common features in sets of information.</p><p></p><p>They identified “topoi,” or patterns, which were those general features shared in any idea or argument regardless of the content of that argument, including definition, relationship, and/or division. For instance, ancient rhetoricians might ask “Is the argument about a definition?” If they discovered that a definition was, in fact, controversial, then they knew they could follow certain common patterns and use common strategies. Other common patterns included comparison and cause-and-effect.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that these common patterns of human thought exist, will help you as a writer to both develop and organize information in your essays. The following image identifies common patterns. Although it refers to “paragraph” patterns, understand that these are also common patterns for whole essays.</p><br />

                            7. ESSAY WRITING. Min. of 3 por, Mers of 5 pr. - Differentiate the patterns of development in writing and state its uses.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Writing is an essential part of communication, and its effectiveness lies in its ability to convey information in a clear and coherent manner. To achieve this, writers use different patterns of development in their writing, which are techniques used to organize ideas and convey a specific message. These patterns of development are essential in creating a strong and effective piece of writing. In this essay, we will differentiate the patterns of development in writing and state their uses.</p><p></p><p>The patterns of development in writing are essential in constructing a well-organized piece of writing. They include narration, description, definition, process analysis, comparison and contrast, classification, cause and effect, argument and persuasion, and evaluation. Each pattern of development serves a unique purpose in writing, and the writer must determine which pattern to use based on the purpose of their writing.</p><p></p><p>Narration is a pattern of development that involves telling a story or describing a series of events. This pattern is commonly used in fiction writing or personal narratives, where the writer seeks to engage the reader and convey a sense of emotion or experience. Description, on the other hand, is a pattern of development that involves using sensory details to create a mental image of a person, place, or thing. This pattern is commonly used in descriptive essays or creative writing, where the writer seeks to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind.</p><p></p><p>Definition is a pattern of development that involves providing a clear and concise explanation of a concept or idea. This pattern is commonly used in academic writing or technical writing, where the writer seeks to provide a precise meaning of a term or concept. Process analysis is a pattern of development that involves breaking down a complex process into simple steps. This pattern is commonly used in instructional writing or technical writing, where the writer seeks to provide a clear and easy-to-follow guide.</p><p></p><p>Comparison and contrast is a pattern of development that involves examining the similarities and differences between two or more objects, concepts, or ideas. This pattern is commonly used in persuasive writing, where the writer seeks to convince the reader of a particular viewpoint. Classification is a pattern of development that involves grouping similar objects or ideas into categories. This pattern is commonly used in academic writing or technical writing, where the writer seeks to organize information in a logical and coherent manner.</p><p></p><p>Cause and effect is a pattern of development that involves examining the relationship between two or more events. This pattern is commonly used in academic writing or technical writing, where the writer seeks to explain the consequences of a particular action or event. Argument and persuasion are patterns of development that involve presenting a particular viewpoint and providing evidence to support it. This pattern is commonly used in persuasive writing or academic writing, where the writer seeks to convince the reader of a particular argument. Evaluation is a pattern of development that involves assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a particular object, concept, or idea. This pattern is commonly used in critical writing or academic writing, where the writer seeks to provide a balanced and objective assessment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the patterns of development in writing serve a unique purpose in organizing ideas and conveying a specific message. Each pattern is essential in creating a well-organized and effective piece of writing. A writer must determine which pattern to use based on the purpose of their writing, the intended audience, and the type of information they are presenting. By understanding the patterns of development in writing, a writer can effectively convey their message and engage their readers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hope it helps!</strong></p><p></p><br />

The Covid 19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all of us in recent years; most people who used to interact are now introverts who are experiencing social anxiety.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Problem with Single-Use Plastics and the Solution for a Sustainable Future</p><p></p><p>Single-use plastics have become a ubiquitous part of modern life. From plastic bags and water bottles to straws and utensils, these products are used once and then discarded, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. The problem with single-use plastics is that they take hundreds of years to decompose, polluting our oceans, landfills, and ecosystems in the process. This poses a significant threat to our planet's health and sustainability.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there are solutions to this problem. One of the most effective solutions is reducing our reliance on single-use plastics by replacing them with reusable alternatives. For example, instead of using plastic bags, people can bring their own reusable bags when shopping. Similarly, instead of buying bottled water, people can use refillable water bottles.</p><p></p><p>Another solution is to recycle as much plastic as possible. Many types of single-use plastics, such as water bottles and food containers, are recyclable. However, not all plastic is recyclable, and many people do not properly dispose of recyclable materials, contributing to the problem.</p><p></p><p>Education and awareness campaigns can also play a significant role in reducing the use of single-use plastics. By educating people about the negative impact of these products on the environment and promoting sustainable alternatives, we can change people's attitudes and behaviors towards single-use plastics.</p><p></p><p>Governments and businesses also have a responsibility to address this issue. Governments can impose regulations and taxes on single-use plastics, such as banning certain types of plastic products or implementing a tax on single-use plastic bags. Businesses can also play a role by using sustainable materials and packaging, and promoting reusable alternatives to their customers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the problem of single-use plastics is a growing environmental crisis that poses a significant threat to our planet's health and sustainability. However, there are effective solutions to this problem, including reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, recycling, education and awareness campaigns, and government and business interventions. By taking action and implementing these solutions, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The kinetic molecular theory can be used to describe the behavior of solids and liquids, just as it can for gaseous substances. An atom, molecule, or ion will be referred to as a particle in the following definition. It's worth noting that we'll use the term "intermolecular attraction" to refer to the attractive forces that exist between the particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are atoms or molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase are reflected in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas. The relative extents of a substance's intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules determine the process in which it resides. The different forces of attraction that can exist between the atoms are referred to as IMFs.</p><br />

The main cause of this trend is the advancement of technology and the availability of education-focused apps and programs. As a result, teachers are able to incorporate technology into their lessons, making them more interactive and engaging for students. This has led to a positive effect on student learning, as research has shown that technology can enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, technology in the classroom also allows for better communication and collaboration among students and teachers. Students can easily share their work and ideas with each other, and teachers can provide instant feedback and support. This creates a more dynamic and interactive learning environment, which can improve student engagement and motivation.</p><p></p><p>However, the increased use of technology in the classroom also comes with some drawbacks. Some students may become overly reliant on technology and lose their ability to think independently. Additionally, not all students have access to technology at home, which can create a digital divide and hinder their ability to fully participate in class.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the use of technology in the classroom has both positive and negative effects. While it can enhance learning and engagement, it is important for educators to carefully consider its potential drawbacks and ensure that all students have equal access to technology.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Many things have changed as a result of COVID-19. Normally I would be at school on the weekdays expanding my mind, but with everything happening with COVID-19 my school and many others have been shut down for the remainder of the year. Instead of being in a classroom and learning, we are sent packets and given work online. You’re probably thinking "well at least you still get to learn,” and that may be true but not everyone has the resources to learn, or maybe we learn better in a classroom setting. School being closed is just one way COVID-19 has caused a lot of damage.
</p><p>
</p><p>I haven't really left my house to see firsthand the damage caused by COVID-19, but the first time I did leave my house it was frightening. I've always thought that COVID-19 will just blow over, no need to worry. But slowly that little thought of hope has been replaced with fear. When I first left my house in weeks to restock on supplies and groceries, I wasn't expecting the world to be in such a panic. Many stores were sold out of supplies. My mom and I went to Mike's Fresh Market, which was filled with desperate people in need of food and home supplies. The instant we got in the store, my mom started shopping as if all of the supplies would be gone before we had the chance to get them. Luckily for us, there was still food and supplies for us to buy.
</p><p>
</p><p>My mom picked up a few things and headed into a long line, which we waited in for about 20 minutes. As we stood in that line, I silently watched the people around us. Many adults and kids were wearing blue and yellow face masks, with latex gloves to protect their hands. Though everyone was so close, we were so separated. Usually, people would be socializing but everyone just wanted to protect themselves. That’s when it hit me: COVID-19 won't just blow over — it's a pandemic that's slowly sweeping throughout the nation wreaking havoc everywhere it goes. While standing in that line I overheard a conversation with two elderly men and a lady. They were talking about how many jobs were being cut and how the government was setting a curfew. My mom overheard their conversation, and she chimed in with a joke. "Finally! A break.” They all laughed. Soon the line moved along. We rang up our purchases and left the store. That was a few weeks ago, the last time I left my house.
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm an introvert but I’m used to a little social interaction. Now that’s not even an option, and I feel isolated from the real world. Waking up and doing the same thing over and over in my house gets boring. But if it means I play a part in the ending of COVID-19 I'll do what I can. I try not to worry much when thinking of COVID-19, but one fear always creeps in. My mom works two jobs. She works at a plant and Dollar Tree. Though the plant is closed she still has to go to Dollar Tree since it is an essential store. Knowing she deals with a lot of people I know there’s a fair chance she can come in contact with COVID-19 but, I always wash that fear away because I know she is taking the precautions to prevent the germs.
</p><p>
</p><p>When my mom goes to work, she makes sure she disinfects her whole work area. She also brings a personal hand sanitizer with her to clean her hands. When her shift is over, she still has to put back stock, so she wears latex gloves to prevent any contamination. When she gets off work every day she comes straight in and takes a shower. Every night she washes her clothes; she says it’s to stop the germs from traveling. My mom fears catching the virus and spreading it to our family. But she knows she still has to provide for her family and keep her commitment to her job.

</p><p>The BGCSM has helped alleviate many of my fears. They also have provided a form of social interaction. Knowing that in this time of crisis the BGCSM is still trying to make our lives somewhat normal is amazing. With school being closed, we really need this social interaction. Besides participating at the Boys and Girls Club, many kids participate in school activities. For instance, I would participate in advanced tutoring groups and a dance group. But now with those things are over, you would expect the Boys &amp; Girls Club to end too, but they didn't. They help keep our interest alive and keep our minds active, and I thank them for that.

                            24. Create a composition/essay of any topic you want with the use of patterns of development in writing you've learned.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Patterns of Development Overview</p><p>Most academic essays have an overall structure – introduction leading to a thesis, body, conclusion. Essays also have topic sentences and units of support that constitute the body, and these topic sentences and units of support need to be ordered logically in a way that’s appropriate to the essay’s thesis.</p><p></p><p>decorative image</p><p>In addition to the concept of the thesis indicating a general, logical order for the support, there are actually many different ways to think about and organize information in the body of an essay, using different patterns of development. These patterns, referred to academically as “rhetorical modes,” mirror the ways in which humans think about their worlds and organize their thoughts in order to communicate.</p><p></p><p>The concept of rhetorical modes actually goes back to ancient civilizations. Though it seems particularly pressing in our current social media, online-all-the-time culture, the idea of “information overload” has troubled humans for centuries. Despite these concerns, many of our ancestors found productive ways to manage information overload. And their strategies remain helpful today. Ancient rhetoricians, including Aristotle and Cicero, developed techniques that writers used to gather, categorize, and explore common features in sets of information.</p><p></p><p>They identified “topoi,” or patterns, which were those general features shared in any idea or argument regardless of the content of that argument, including definition, relationship, and/or division. For instance, ancient rhetoricians might ask “Is the argument about a definition?” If they discovered that a definition was, in fact, controversial, then they knew they could follow certain common patterns and use common strategies. Other common patterns included comparison and cause-and-effect.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest pls</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:<br />Climate change is happening now. Evidences being seen support the fact that the change cannot simply be explained by natural variation. The most recent scientific assessments have confirmed that this warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely to be due to human activities; and thus, is due to the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and land use change. Current warming has increasingly posed quite considerable challenges to man and the environment, and will continue to do so in the future. Presently, some autonomous adaptation is taking place, but we need to consider a more pro-active adaptation planning in order to ensure sustainable development.<br /><br /></strong><strong>Hope i can help you!</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I prefer the Chronological Pattern of Development and my topic is "The History of the Internet". The concept of the Internet started in the late 1960s as a way for government researchers to communicate. In the 1970s, the Internet was expanded to include universities and other research institutions. The first commercial Internet service provider, CompuServe, was established in 1979. The World Wide Web, which made the Internet accessible to the general public, was created in 1989. The 1990s saw a rapid growth in the number of Internet users and the development of e-commerce. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s brought a wave of new Internet-based companies. The early 2000s saw the growth of social media, with the launch of My Space in 2003 and Face book in 2004. The Internet has continued to evolve and expand, with the rise of mobile devices and cloud computing. Today, the Internet has become an essential part of daily life for many people, connecting them with friends, family, and information. The future of the Internet is uncertain, but it is likely to continue to play a major role in shaping society and the world.</p><p></p><p>(っ◔◡◔)っ ❤ Keep on slaying, study first ❤</p><br />

I cooked her favorite dishes, and we enjoyed our breakfast together while talking about our plans for the day. After breakfast, I surprised her with a bouquet of flowers and a cute Valentine's Day card.</p><p></p><p>We decided to spend the day exploring the city and trying out different activities. We started by visiting a museum and learning about the history of our city. We then went to an amusement park and went on various rides, laughing and enjoying each other's company. We also had a romantic lunch at a cozy restaurant, where we shared some delicious food and talked about our future plans.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, we went for a walk by the beach and watched the sunset together.

I was touched by his thoughtfulness and felt so loved.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Looking back on that Valentine's Day, I realize that it was not just about the gifts or the romantic gestures. It was about the love and connection that my boyfriend and I shared. It was about the memories we created together and the bond that we formed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Valentine's Day is a special day that celebrates love and all the wonderful things that come with it. Whether you spend it with a significant other, friends, or family, it is a day to cherish and appreciate the people in your life who bring you joy and happiness. Through my personal experience, I have come to understand that Valentine's Day is not just about the material things, but rather about the love and connection that is shared between two people.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest </p><br />
