                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Without a support system for the arts, they will not continue to flourish. The arts need to have people view the work and think about it or feel something about it.</p><p></p><p>In many cases artists prepare a vision of how things are going to be that helps others adjust to, or divert, these changes because of having gotten a preview. Without a support system for the arts that opportunity would not be there.</p><p></p><p>The arts also unify many different cultures because the common threads of humanity are shared by all, even when language is not. They allow us to empathize with others and see them as humans like us. This is a good thing because it keeps the need for preservation of all at the forefront of our minds collectively. Without the support of the arts. That treasured viewpoint, or realization would be lost.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
