National strength can only be built on character.2. The Filipinos of the past became strong-willed, earnest, and adventurous by necessity. They had to brave the seas, clear the forest, and erect towns and cities upon the wilderness in order to establish communities.3. To ensure the accomplishment of this task of national spiritual reconstruction, we shall formulate and adopt a social code that can be explained in the schools, preached from the pulpits, and taught in the streets and plazas, and in the remotest corners of our land.4. Teachers are in the best position to inculcate this social code in the youth because they are in the most contact with them during their formative years at school.5. During the last 40 years, life's been too easy for us. We have secured political rights almost for the asking and we have gained prosperity not only because of the bounties of our extraordinarily fertile soil, but also through the advantages that our economic association with the richest and most generous people in the world has given us.MARK AS BRAINLEST KO MAKASGOT.​</a>

gravity into a large cluster of stars called the galaxy. The stars of the galaxy revolve about its center as the planets revolve about the sun. The sun itself participates in this rotating 
motion, completing one circuit around the galaxy in 250 million years. —from “The Size of Things” in Red Giants and White Dwarfs by Robert Jastrow_____________2. Members of the fire department were starting to arrive at the front door, but 
Albert ignored them. He was white now, like death, and he made a low terrible sound. He 
did not exactly pull his lips back from his teeth and growl, but the result was similar. It was 
like the sound a dog makes before he leaps for the throat. And what he said was “You just leave me be, woman!” —from “Be-ers and Doers” by Budge Wilson ____________3. As public schools reopen for the new year, strategies to curb school violence 
will once again be hotly debated. Installing metal detectors and hiring security guards will 
help, but the experience of my two sisters makes a compelling case for greater use of dress 
codes as a way to protect students and promote learning. —from “Appearances Are Destructive” by Mark Mathabane___________4. Across the street lived old Dikran, who was almost blind. He was past eighty 
and his wife was only a few years younger. They had a little house that was as neat inside 
as it was ordinary outside—except for old Dikran’s garden, which was the best thing of its kind in the world. Plants, bushes, trees—all strong, in sweet black moist earth whose 
guardian was old Dikran. All things from the sky loved this spot in our poor neighborhood, 
and old Dikran loved them. —from “The Hummingbird That Lived through Winter ” by

The city government is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced, based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutions suggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate the scale of cars and other vehicles. 17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a few electronic devices. Put your new speakers too close to the monitor, for instance, and you may see a distortion of color and resolution – a distortion that can become permanent.18. India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is the lack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that the government could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these unsanctioned settlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to be alleviated. 19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians have been decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over the course of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions. This method should yield reliable data that will help researchers understand the extent to which amphibian populations are in danger and begin to determine the answers to the problem. 20. In the country Ghana, most of the people have problems in transportation. They do not have enough money to afford a car. The people of Ghana are also too poor to finance the construction of factories that build traditional steel bikes. One effective solution is to provide a bike made of bamboo.

National strength can only be built on character.2. The Filipinos of the past became strong-willed, earnest, and adventurous by necessity. They had to brave the seas, clear the forest, and erect towns and cities upon the wilderness in order to establish communities.3. To ensure the accomplishment of this task of national spiritual reconstruction, we shall formulate and adopt a social code that can be explained in the schools, preached from the pulpits, and taught in the streets and plazas, and in the remotest corners of our land.4. Teachers are in the best position to inculcate this social code in the youth because they are in the most contact with them during their formative years at school.5. During the last 40 years, life's been too easy for us. We have secured political rights almost for the asking and we have gained prosperity not only because of the bounties of our extraordinarily fertile soil, but also through the advantages that our economic association with the richest and most generous people in the world has given us.MARK AS BRAINLEST KO MAKASGOT.​</h2><br />

gravity into a large cluster of stars called the galaxy. The stars of the galaxy revolve about its center as the planets revolve about the sun. The sun itself participates in this rotating 
motion, completing one circuit around the galaxy in 250 million years. —from “The Size of Things” in Red Giants and White Dwarfs by Robert Jastrow_____________2. Members of the fire department were starting to arrive at the front door, but 
Albert ignored them. He was white now, like death, and he made a low terrible sound. He 
did not exactly pull his lips back from his teeth and growl, but the result was similar. It was 
like the sound a dog makes before he leaps for the throat. And what he said was “You just leave me be, woman!” —from “Be-ers and Doers” by Budge Wilson ____________3. As public schools reopen for the new year, strategies to curb school violence 
will once again be hotly debated. Installing metal detectors and hiring security guards will

and his wife was only a few years younger. They had a little house that was as neat inside 
as it was ordinary outside—except for old Dikran’s garden, which was the best thing of its kind in the world. Plants, bushes, trees—all strong, in sweet black moist earth whose 
guardian was old Dikran. All things from the sky loved this spot in our poor neighborhood, 
and old Dikran loved them. —from “The Hummingbird That Lived through Winter ” by

The city government is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced, based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutions suggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate the scale of cars and other vehicles. 17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a few electronic devices.

India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is the lack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that the government could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these unsanctioned settlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to be alleviated. 19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians have been decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over the course of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions.
