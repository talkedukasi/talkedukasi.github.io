                                            Directions: From the given paragraph below, identify the argument made by the author. (1). Children must learn how to use social media responsibly. One reason is that social media poses danger to their security. Experts say that 75 percent of teens have profiles on a social media networking site. Such profiles mostly contain their photos, real names, birthdates, interests, and even their town and school. Online advertisers and predators can easily take the children’s information and use it for illegal activities. Argument:________________​</a>

How is an idea or story presented in a live performance? How is it different from a music video?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>3. Philippine Operas:</p><p>Philippine operas are characterized by a fusion of Western and Filipino musical elements. They often feature arias, duets, and choruses, and are performed in a combination of Tagalog and Spanish. The stories are usually based on Philippine history, folklore, or social issues. The music is accompanied by elaborate sets, costumes, and choreography, and the performances are often grand and theatrical.</p><p></p><p>5. Ballets:</p><p>Ballets are characterized by their use of dance to tell a story. They often feature classical music and intricate choreography, with dancers performing in elaborate costumes and sets. The stories are usually based on fairy tales, myths, or literary works. Ballets require a high level of technical skill and training, and are often performed by professional dance companies.</p><p></p><p>6. Musical Plays:</p><p>Musical plays are characterized by their use of music, dance, and dialogue to tell a story. They often feature popular music styles such as jazz, rock, or pop, and the stories are usually based on contemporary issues or popular culture. Musical plays require a high level of performance skill, and are often performed by professional theater companies.</p><p></p><p>7. Media and the Development of Musical Genres:</p><p>Media, specifically radio, television, video, and recordings, played a significant role in the development of musical genres. These media allowed for wider distribution and exposure of musical performances, and enabled audiences to experience the performances without being physically present. This led to the popularization of musical genres, and allowed for the creation of new musical styles.</p><p></p><p>Broadway Musicals:</p><p>Broadway musicals are characterized by their use of popular music styles, elaborate sets and costumes, and high production values. They often feature a combination of music, dance, and dialogue to tell a story, and are performed by professional theater companies. Broadway musicals became popular due to their ability to entertain and engage audiences, and their ability to address contemporary issues and social commentary.</p><p></p><p>Relevance of Musical Plays:</p><p>Musical plays are still relevant to life in the 20th century, as they continue to address contemporary issues and social commentary. They also provide a form of entertainment and escapism for audiences, and allow for the expression of creativity and artistic expression.</p><p></p><p>Theatrical Elements and Music in Achieving Special Effects:</p><p>Theatrical elements such as lighting, sound effects, and stage design are combined with music and media to achieve special effects in musical plays. These elements work together to create a cohesive and immersive performance experience, and can be used to enhance the emotional impact of the story.</p><p></p><p>Presentation of Ideas and Stories in Live Performance vs. Music Videos:</p><p>In a live performance, ideas and stories are presented through a combination of music, dance, and dialogue, with the performers physically present on stage. This allows for a more immersive and interactive experience for the audience. In contrast, music videos present ideas and stories through a pre-recorded visual medium, with the performers often not physically present. This allows for a more controlled and edited presentation of the story, but may not provide the same level of emotional impact as a live performance.</p><p></p><br />
