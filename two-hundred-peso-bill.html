Keeping the money for myself without trying to find the owner would be<strong> dishonest</strong> and not in line with <strong>good moral values</strong>. </p><p>If I am unsure if the classmate is the rightful owner of the money, I am going to ask them if they lost a hundred-peso bill and see if they can <strong>provide any details</strong> that match the bill I found. If they cannot provide any information that suggests they are the owner, I could <strong>consider other options</strong>, such as turning the money over to a teacher or school administrator for safekeeping until the rightful owner is found.</p><p>In this situation, it would be appropriate to apologize to my classmate for not returning the money sooner if that is the case. Apologizing shows that I understand that <strong>keeping the money</strong> without trying to find the owner was wrong and makes me remorseful for my actions. It is always important to <strong>take responsibility</strong> for my actions and to make amends when necessary.
