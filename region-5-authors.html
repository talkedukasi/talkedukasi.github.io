                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makes
</p><p>comparison with flowers?
</p><p>
</p><p>Answer:  Helen, thy beauty is to me  </p><p>Like those Nice'an barks of yore,
</p><p>-This line is like flowers whenever you see it, its makes beauty and nice to your eyes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?
</p><p>Answer: It’s Helen.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:
</p><p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
</p><p>Low statue-like I see thee stand,
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Answer: The speaker is floored by Helen's beauty as he sees her standing in the "window niche" (like a nook). Saying "Lo" is like saying OMG when you all of a sudden see something astonishing. Helen is standing "statue-like," which means both that she resembles a work of art and that she is not moving at all.

</p><p>Answer: The tone of the poem is written in admiration in a heavenly and dreamy language towards the stellar features of the legendary Helen of Troy set in the picturesque ancient Greek where various aspects of creativity and theory developed. It also shows the underlying love Poe has for his first lady, Jane Stanard.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?
</p><p>Answer: Yes, it has shown there through his stanzas you could tell how he described Helen and how their lives together as well as his life being with Helen.
