                                            LESSON 5: RATIONAL CHOICE THEORYActivity 1:         TRUE OR FALSEInstruction: Read each statement carefully and determine if it’s true or false. Write T if the statement is true and F if the statement is false._______ 1. Rational choice theory when applied to economics means that people estimate the probable costs and benefits of any action before deciding what to do._______ 2. Rational choice theory when used as a political theory is built on the two-fold initial beliefs that states that individual behavior is the key to understanding the functioning of political institutions._______ 3. The beginnings of the foundations of rational choice can be traced during the Renaissance._______ 4. Thomas Hobbes, in his writing Leviathan (1651) tried to explain the basic functioning of political institutions through collective choices which came from universally held likes and dislikes._______ 5. Adam Smith introduced the idea of self-interest in having rational choice by asserting that “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from the regard to their own interest.”_______ 6. George Homans was credited for establishing the rational choice on Political Science._______7. Utility maximization as one of the key concepts in Rational Choice Theory states that patterns of behavior in societies is characterized by minimization of benefits and maximization of costs.______ 8. Structure of preferences refers to the idea that people are motivated by their personal desires and aspirations, but since it is not possible for them to attain all the things that they want, they must make choices related to their goals and means of attaining those goals.______ 9. Decision making under condition of uncertainty means that individual takes full advantage of the likely worth of his own pay off.______10. Centrality of individuals in the explanation of group outcomes means that it is by reference to the maximizing of group actions that individual outcomes must be explained.​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the following carefully. Write T if the statementis true and if the statement is false.1. Critique or review is a genre of academic writing which briefly summarizes andcritically evaluates a work or concept.2. Writing a critique on a work helps us to develop a fault-finding ability within one'sself.3. Critiques can be used to carefully analyze a variety of works such as novels,exhibite, film, images, poetry, monographs, journal articles, systematic reviews, theories,news reports, feature articles, and the like.4. Critical approaches sometimes called lenses, are different perspectives we canconsider when looking at a piece or several pieces of work.5. Feminism examines a literary work in terms of its form and lernents likecharacters, setting, plot, point-of-view, theme, symbolism, figures of speech, etc.6. Pormalism focuses on socio-economic status or on the unequal distribution ofwealth and resources between rich and poor.7. Reader response approach focuses on the discrimination, unequal treatment, andprejudices of women in the society,8. Marxism approach allows the writer to give his or her own assumptions orreactions on the event seen or article read.9. The purpose of critical approaches is to help us answer questions, as well ashelping us interpret and understand a variety of works.10. One of the reasons in writing critique is to recognize the strengths andweaknesses of the work.​</a>

                                            true or false. 1. any academic discipline doesn't need a focal point so that research, investigation, and commentary can generate applicable insights. " labor " or " industrial" relations can become a very broad topic including many academic concern.2. compensation work rules, such as a negotiates wage rate , often capture the attention of employees and the media because they are negotiation outcomes harder for most people to understand and compare.3. management consultants are individuals hired from outside the organization to provide some special services or expertise.4. organizations with a good quality labor- management relationship may gain a competitive advantage over firms that lack the ability to gain cooperation and consensus from employees in seeking to change to meet new competitive pressures.5. most employees want their organizations to be competitive and at the same time, they want to share in the rewards of competitive success.6. In the private sector the federal government has traditionally played an indirect role in determining the outcomes of work rule negotiations, unlike the role of government in many other industrialized countries.7. union and management officials cannot negotiate a mandatory retirement age of 60 years because this would conflict with the age discrimination in employment act.8. first, the adoption and support of a free enterprise (capitalist) economic system in the United States creates an inherent conflict of interest between employers (owners) and employees. both employees and employers seek to advance their own self-interests.9. the unemployment rate affects work rules providing job protection.10. the labor relations process can be affected by the product or service market where the company either sells it's product or purchases key elements required for production of it's products or services.​</a>

We analyse data from two large UK social surveys (Ns = 16,966 and 44,903) that assessed the importance respondents attached to various identities within their self‐concepts, and find that social class plays a crucial role. Our results show that respondents attached high importance to identities that are indicative of their social class (income, education, and professional), and at least as much importance as they gave to identities more commonly studied by psychologists (such as ethnicity, nationality, or gender). Furthermore, respondents’ objective social class was one of the strongest predictors of the importance they attached to different types of identities: Higher class respondents placed greater importance on identities that are indicative of their social class, but less importance on identities based on basic demographics, chosen communities, or their sociocultural orientation. Our results suggest that social class plays an important role in structuring the self‐concept, and that researchers should pay more attention to the importance of social class to self and identity processes.</p><br />

Thomas Hobbes, in his writing Leviathan (1651) tried to explain the basic functioning of political institutions through collective choices which came from universally held likes and dislikes._______ 5. Adam Smith introduced the idea of self-interest in having rational choice by asserting that “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from the regard to their own interest.”_______ 6. George Homans was credited for establishing the rational choice on Political Science._______7. Utility maximization as one of the key concepts in Rational Choice Theory states that patterns of behavior in societies is characterized by minimization of benefits and maximization of costs.______ 8. Structure of preferences refers to the idea that people are motivated by their personal desires and aspirations, but since it is not possible for them to attain all the things that they want, they must make choices related to their goals and means of attaining those goals.______ 9. Decision making under condition of uncertainty means that individual takes full advantage of the likely worth of his own pay off.______10. Centrality of individuals in the explanation of group outcomes means that it is by reference to the maximizing of group actions that individual outcomes must be explained.​</h2><br />
