                                             pa answer po i will mark and follow you plsDirections: Using a letter, persuade your teacher why you should choose your own seats when we return to face to face classes.   Example:     Dear teacher,  It would be wonderful to choose our own seats and here’s why.         We could choose to sit away from those who are distracting us. It is very hard to me to focus when my seatmate, ask me questions every minute and tell jokes. Without these distractions, I could focus better on the discussion and seatwork.          Also, we would be much happier if we could choose our seats. Happier students are better behaved students and that’s a win-win for everyone. You don’t have to stop teaching to redirect us and we get better grades because we can focus.         You’re probably thinking that if you let us choose where we want to sit, then everybody would just sit with their friends. But I think that’s a weak argument because if we’re sitting next to someone who doesn’t like us and they’re mean to us, we will rebel and cause disruptions in class. All of us want to do well, and I believe that we are mature enough to choose a spot where we are sitting with someone we like but also can focus in class.

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges her otherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enough comparison for her family; yet, she has not left any for herself.Questions:1.

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

An example is given as your guide.this is task 2:WHAT DO JAPANESE THINK ABOUT FILIPINOS?(an excerpt)Japanese believes that Filipinos are extremely fun! In fact, many peopleconsider Filipinos to be the Latin Americans of Asia due to their happy party spirit.Japanese think that Filipinos are great dancers and excellent at hosting or attendingparties, making every spot they go to an entertaining place where even the shiestperson can shine and have fun. Meanwhile, Japanese considers women from thePhilippines to be very beautiful, and it’s easy to see why. To make things moreimpressive, the Philippines has the longest streak of wins, meaning that the country’srecent climb to the top has been very fast. As a result of all this media exposure,many Japanese have become aware of how beautiful Filipinas are, making themthink of them as beauty queens. The Philippines also has so many beauty pageantsthat it could easily be considered a sport. On the other hand, it is perceived by theJapanese that Filipinos are also regarded as friends one can rely on since they are there to listen to you and support you. In difficult times when someone needs to leteverything out of their system, it’s considered that no one around you will trulyempathize with you like a Filipino will. That’s one of the many reasons Japanese likehaving their Filipino friends around! Furthermore, Japanese thinks, Filipinos have afantastic sense of community, which is why Japanese have found out howadvantageous it is to have good Filipino friends around. They can truly complementone’s life.</a>

                        <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is presenting other people's work or ideas as your own, with or without their permission. It is by including it into your work without full acknowledgment from the owner. All<strong> published and unpublished material </strong>in any form is covered under this description. Nowadays, there is available <strong>plagiarism detection software</strong> to identify content resemblance. The <strong>plagiarism software</strong> scans a database of content and identifies its components, then compares it to the content of other work.

</p>UP Student Plagiarizes Prize-winning Photos
<p>These are the answer to the questions about the UP student plagiarizes prize-winning photos:
</p><strong>Mark Joseph Solis </strong>submitted a plagiarized photo at Smiles for the world photo contest headed by Chilean, Ambassador Roberto Mayorga. He is  a UP alumnus who plagiarized award-winning photos from an international photographer named Gregory John Smith
.<p></p>The organizing committee<strong> forfeits the prize money</strong> amounting to  $1000  and asks Solis to pay the round trip tickets expenses to travel in Chile and Brazil.
<p>
</p>Yes, I agree that technology made plagiarism accessible. It is because there is software that can use to download and edit the works of other people. Also, many people are being dishonest to get fame and power by using other people's ideas.<p></p>Types of Plagiarism

                            5.  pa answer po i will mark and follow you plsDirections: Using a letter, persuade your teacher why you should choose your own seats when we return to face to face classes.   Example:     Dear teacher,  It would be wonderful to choose our own seats and here’s why.         We could choose to sit away from those who are distracting us. It is very hard to me to focus when my seatmate, ask me questions every minute and tell jokes. Without these distractions, I could focus better on the discussion and seatwork.          Also, we would be much happier if we could choose our seats. Happier students are better behaved students and that’s a win-win for everyone. You don’t have to stop teaching to redirect us and we get better grades because we can focus.         You’re probably thinking that if you let us choose where we want to sit, then everybody would just sit with their friends. But I think that’s a weak argument because if we’re sitting next to someone who doesn’t like us and they’re mean to us, we will rebel and cause disruptions in class. All of us want to do well, and I believe that we are mature enough to choose a spot where we are sitting with someone we like but also can focus in class.

                            8. Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges her otherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enough comparison for her family; yet, she has not left any for herself.Questions:1.

Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

                        I’ll answer the first topic which is “Should school be taught online instead of in a classroom?”<br /><br />To answer that question in my personal opinion, no.<br /><br />You see, there are a lot of benefits regarding studying at school more than online. You see your friends more, and interact socially with people, and you absorb more knowledge that way since a teacher is teaching you. Not self taught or whatever. You can also go to different rooms whenever you have different classes which I think kind of contributes to getting fit. There’s really countless reasons on why Offline Classes &gt; Online Classes<br /><br /><br />This is my personal opinion, hope it helps.

Make sure to include: → Name of game → Rules for game (include all necessary pieces to play) Step 2: Create a tree diagram that demonstrates the possible outcomes of a participant playing the game. Also, decide whether or not the fundamental counting principle can be applied to the game. If so, how? If not, explain why in a complete sentence. Provide an example and explanation.  Step 3: Determine if the game utilizes the concepts of permutations or combinations. Explain your reasons using complete sentences.

                        Game Idea: Ring Toss<br /><br />Objective: To toss rings onto bottles and earn points based on which bottle the ring lands on.<br /><br />Rules:<br />1. The game can be played by one or more players.<br />2. The player is given a set of rings to toss onto a set of bottles.<br />3. Each bottle has a different point value based on its location.<br />4. The player earns points based on which bottle the ring lands on.<br />5. The player with the highest number of points wins.<br /><br />Step 2: Tree Diagram<br />Yes, the fundamental counting principle can be applied to this game. The possible outcomes can be determined by multiplying the number of rings by the number of bottles.<br /><br />Example:<br />If there are 3 rings and 5 bottles, the total number of possible outcomes is 3 x 5 = 15.<br /><br />Step 3: Permutations or Combinations<br />This game utilizes the concept of combinations since the order of the bottles does not matter. The player can earn points regardless of which order the bottles are landed on.<br /><br />Step 4: Theoretical Probability (Optional)<br />The theoretical probability of the game can be calculated by dividing the number of ways to win by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if there are 5 bottles with point values of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the player has 3 rings to toss, the total number of possible outcomes is 125 (5 x 5 x 5). The number of ways to earn a score of 10 or higher would be the sum of the number of ways to earn 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 points. This probability can be calculated by dividing the number of ways to win (6) by the total number of possible outcomes (125), which is 0.048 or approximately 5%. <br /><br />Fairness:<br />To make the game more difficult, the point values of the bottles could be adjusted or the distance between the bottles and the player could be increased. To make the game fairer, the point values of the bottles could be evenly distributed, or the number of rings could be adjusted based on the skill level of the player.<br />

In fact, many peopleconsider Filipinos to be the Latin Americans of Asia due to their happy party spirit.Japanese think that Filipinos are great dancers and excellent at hosting or attendingparties, making every spot they go to an entertaining place where even the shiestperson can shine and have fun. Meanwhile, Japanese considers women from thePhilippines to be very beautiful, and it’s easy to see why. To make things moreimpressive, the Philippines has the longest streak of wins, meaning that the country’srecent climb to the top has been very fast. As a result of all this media exposure,many Japanese have become aware of how beautiful Filipinas are, making themthink of them as beauty queens. The Philippines also has so many beauty pageantsthat it could easily be considered a sport. On the other hand, it is perceived by theJapanese that Filipinos are also regarded as friends one can rely on since they are there to listen to you and support you. In difficult times when someone needs to leteverything out of their system, it’s considered that no one around you will trulyempathize with you like a Filipino will. That’s one of the many reasons Japanese likehaving their Filipino friends around! Furthermore, Japanese thinks, Filipinos have afantastic sense of community, which is why Japanese have found out howadvantageous it is to have good Filipino friends around. They can truly complementone’s life.</h2><br />
