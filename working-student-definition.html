                                            Direction: Read the situation presented below. Make a moral decision on the dilemma presented below. Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore. These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized. As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case however, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case. ​</a>

 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations. Given the analogy between the two, it is emphasized that education is very possible despite all circumstances that may happen and that the quality of education will not be sacrificed.</a>

Clarification1..All pressures in school due to paper works, projects, work immersions and the like could be overcame through proper time management. In other words, a student must learn to budget her time properly, that is, to allot more time in academic undertakings than social media engagements. Give priorities for those projects that are up for deadlines. Make sure to accomplish even one of these in a week or if possible in a day. Avoid spending time unproductively. 2.

Angela Manalang’s poem “Soledad” depicts how a society governed by norms of the church reacts towards a girl’s action that is believed to be a crime, a mortal sin. The girl in the poem was condemned and adjudged by the people. A scenario that is very typical even in today’s times. 5. The text discusses the variety of reactions earned from the suggested blended teaching and learning process of the Department of Education. Most parents and students agree with the new normal educational system. Moreover, teachers have prepared the needed materials for blended education. Everybody is into knowing the results of this new system. ​</a>

If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore.These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized.As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case. However, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case.____________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore. These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized.

 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

He teaches Ethics to BSAccountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore.These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized.As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case. However, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again.

                            27. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?
