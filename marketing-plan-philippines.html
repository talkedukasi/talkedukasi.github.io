                                            ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</a>

                                            Direction: Read and study the article. Conduct a SWOT Analysis. The Philippines telecommunications industry has long been dominated by legacy players Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe Telecom. A lack of regulatory intervention by the Government has led to an extremely saturated market with a duopoly that does not foster competition. Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps (global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps). The market is split between the two players who offer similar pricing. Globe Telecom has 97 million mobile service subscribers and 2 million broadband subscribers. PLDT has 71.4 million mobile subscribers and 2.1 million broadband subscribers. New entrants, including other local conglomerates, have been hesitant to attempt entering the market. Foreign firms have been even more bearish, due to restrictions on foreign ownership in sectors designated as public utilities. However, the Duterte Administration has sought to change this through the introduction of a third telecom player, and a new Common Tower Policy. DITO Telecom (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium poised to begin operations in March 2021. The Common Tower Policy was also slated to be released during the first quarter of 2020. The policy would have an amendment delisting the telecom sector as a public utility was also supposed to be voted on before the summer. In addition to reforms in the private sector sphere, the Government is also making efforts to reach areas that are underserved through a National Broadband Plan. The plan, with a budget of $450 million, has five components that include bypass cable and fiber optic network layout, national free Wi-Fi, satellite overlay, and the common tower policy. The market will change as reforms are pursued. With full foreign ownership possibilities in the telecom sector, foreign investors will have greater control and likely more significant incentives to pursue the market. The 106 million mobile subscribers would readily switch to an option with better coverage and economical pricing. All players are expected to upgrade their network capabilities, install fiber-optic and sub-sea systems and cables, purchase modern networking equipment/storage/servers, and utilize cloud and cybersecurity services. The biggest purchasers of such equipment would be the two legacy players and the third telecom.

All players are price sensitive and do have a bias of purchasing equipment from China. The market also has a growing segment of smaller broadband providers, such as Converge ICT, One Sky, Rise Enterprise, InfiniVAN, Now Corporation, PT&amp;T, Planet Internet, and Radius Telecom.

                            6. ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</h2><br />

                            7. Direction: Read and study the article. Conduct a SWOT Analysis. The Philippines telecommunications industry has long been dominated by legacy players Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe Telecom. A lack of regulatory intervention by the Government has led to an extremely saturated market with a duopoly that does not foster competition. Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps (global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps). The market is split between the two players who offer similar pricing. Globe Telecom has 97 million mobile service subscribers and 2 million broadband subscribers. PLDT has 71.4 million mobile subscribers and 2.1 million broadband subscribers. New entrants, including other local conglomerates, have been hesitant to attempt entering the market. Foreign firms have been even more bearish, due to restrictions on foreign ownership in sectors designated as public utilities. However, the Duterte Administration has sought to change this through the introduction of a third telecom player, and a new Common Tower Policy. DITO Telecom (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium poised to begin operations in March 2021. The Common Tower Policy was also slated to be released during the first quarter of 2020. The policy would have an amendment delisting the telecom sector as a public utility was also supposed to be voted on before the summer. In addition to reforms in the private sector sphere, the Government is also making efforts to reach areas that are underserved through a National Broadband Plan. The plan, with a budget of $450 million, has five components that include bypass cable and fiber optic network layout, national free Wi-Fi, satellite overlay, and the common tower policy. The market will change as reforms are pursued. With full foreign ownership possibilities in the telecom sector, foreign investors will have greater control and likely more significant incentives to pursue the market. The 106 million mobile subscribers would readily switch to an option with better coverage and economical pricing. All players are expected to upgrade their network capabilities, install fiber-optic and sub-sea systems and cables, purchase modern networking equipment/storage/servers, and utilize cloud and cybersecurity services. The biggest purchasers of such equipment would be the two legacy players and the third telecom. Globe and PLDT's 2020 CAPEX is above $ 1 billion, and DITO plans to spend $5 billion on the rollout of its services in the next 5 years. All players are price sensitive and do have a bias of purchasing equipment from China. The market also has a growing segment of smaller broadband providers, such as Converge ICT, One Sky, Rise Enterprise, InfiniVAN, Now Corporation, PT&amp;T, Planet Internet, and Radius Telecom.
