The important metalle minerals found in various parts of the Philippines include gold, copper, iron chrome made up of chromium, iron, and other matalal nickel, cobalt, and platinum. The most productive copper and gold cars in the Philippines are found in Baguic, the province of Benguet, and in Surigao Davao areas Major producers of nickel are in Palawan and Surigao (DENR Webane 2012) Metals are important. The properties of metals make them useful for specific purposes You learned these in ter 1 fron is the main maternal for steel bars used in buildings and road construction Copper is used in making al wires Tin is the material for milk cana and other preserved food products. Nicket is mixed with copper or other secals to form stainless cooking wares Gold is important in making jewelry The Philippines has also varied nonmetallic resources including sand and gravel limestone, marble, clay and other quarry materials Your teacher will show you a map of the nometallic deposits in the Philippines Locate your are 1 and determine what nonmetallic deposits are found there How are these deposits recovered? How are they used in your community For example What are the uses of sand, gravel, or clay? How are marble stones used? Think of Do you know that the Philippines is listed as the 5th mineral country in the world, 3rd in gold reserves, 4th in cover and sth in nickel! The ores (mineral bearing rocka) are processed out of the country to recover the pure metal The richness of the Philippines in terms of mineral resources is being attributed to its location in the so called Pacific Ring of Fire. The area is associated with over 450 volcances (amall triangles in the map) and is home to approximately 75% of bron filings Quarte Copper ore EXERCISES A Identify the metallic deposits in the Philippines, their location and uses.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

A frequency distribution is a table that shows the frequencies for the categories, values of a counting variable or class
intervals.
Let us consider the following portion of the table.
Class interval Tally Frequency
16 â€“ 20 IIII â€“ II 7
CLASS INTERVAL
In the table above, the class interval is 16 â€“ 20. Its class size is 5 because there are 5 values that the interval may contain,
specifically 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. â€‹</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When the mean is computed for individual data, all values in the data set are used. 14. A single, extremely large value can affect the median more than the mean. 15. One-half of all the data values will fall above the mode, and one-half will fall below the mode 16. In a data set, the mode will always be unique.

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
