                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>Every child has the right to access safe, quality education.</p><p>However, 124 million children across the world are out of school and 250 million are not learning basic skills as a result of poor quality education. Girls, children with disabilities, those from minority groups and children living in poor and remote areas are most often denied access to education. This has far-reaching consequences on their futures and those of their families, communities and countries. We promote free, equal access to quality education for all children – from early learning to secondary education. We work with children, their families, communities, wider society and governments, and advocate at both local and international levels, so that all children are able to get an education.</p><br />

Substantial progress has already been made—in 2000, only 83% of children attended primary school. By 2015, it was up to 91%.
