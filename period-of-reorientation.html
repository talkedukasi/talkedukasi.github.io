This program has adopted Sikolohiyang Pilipino as a program framework in reachingout to children who are victims of trauma.2. This provides subtle distinctiveness in several stages and manners of socialinteraction.3. This is considered as an important aspect of a people's life.4. By teaming up with the Department of Psychology, he initiated the reorientation of theteaching of psychology.5. To address the need of institutionalizing Sikolohiyang Pilipino, it was under Enriquez'sleadership that this organization was founded as a professional organization.6. In ancient times, there was no written history although the natives knew how to write;this is known as the ancient system of their writing.7. Pantayong Pananaw emerged from the UP Department of History under his initiative.8. These were often frowned upon by Western-oriented scholars, but Enriquez insistedthat if these concerns are being valued by Filipinos then they should be legitimatesubjects of psychological studies.9. This term connotes the "unity of self and others".10. His academic stint at the University of the Philippines paved the way for thedevelopment of his indigenous approach in the study of Psychology.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typology of Social Change</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Millions of people worldwide are affected by dramatic social change (DSC). While sociological theory aims to understand its precipitants, the psychological consequences remain poorly understood. A large-scale literature review pointed to the desperate need for a typology of social change that might guide theory and research toward a better understanding of the psychology of social change. Over 5,000 abstracts from peer-reviewed articles were assessed from sociological and psychological publications. Based on stringent inclusion criteria, a final 325 articles were used to construct a novel, multi-level typology designed to conceptualize and categorize social change in terms of its psychological threat to psychological well-being. The typology of social change includes four social contexts: Stability, Inertia, Incremental Social Change and, finally, DSC. Four characteristics of DSC were further identified: the pace of social change, rupture to the social structure, rupture to the normative structure, and the level of threat to one's cultural identity. A theoretical model that links the characteristics of social change together and with the social contexts is also suggested. The typology of social change as well as our theoretical proposition may serve as a foundation for future investigations and increase our understanding of the psychologically adaptive mechanisms used in the wake of DSC.</p><br />
