It follows many other countries in expanding its immunisation drive to minors. Authorities plan a pilot run of a return to face-to-face classes in up to 120 schools next month. The Philippines -33) was among 17 countries globally where schools have been closed for the entirety of the pandemic, according to a September report by the United Nations children's d. it can agency UNICEF. "For me, I'm looking forward to getting back to face-to-face classes nd other in the future," said Gyle Fernandez, 17, one of more than 1,000 children who received 7 million their vaccinations on Friday. The Philippines is prioritising 1.2 million children with Ehold existing health conditions and has approved two vaccine brands for minors. Of its 2.7 ia and million confirmed COVID-19 cases, 7.8% affect young people aged 10-19 years old. over Fatalities among that bracket are comparatively lower, making up 0.6% of the country's more than 40,000 deaths. The Philippines reported 7,625 new coronavirus infections on Friday, among the lowest in two months. New cases fell to a daily average of 10.500 this month compared to nearly 19,000 in September. Jacquelyn Dannug, 40, said she wanted her child, 12, to have protection. "It would be difficult as we are often outside and she could possibly get infected if she is not fully vaccinated," said Dannug, standing beside her daughter. The Philippines will further stare det-elax coronavirus restrictions in the Manila region starting from Saturday. It has so far imental vaccinated nearly 24 million of its 110 million population. -tion Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Susan Fenton air pollution​</a>

                                            Government to prioritize vaccination of adults, minors with health risks By Carolyn Bonquin I CNN Philippines 1 September 29, 2021 Edna Bautista wants a COVID-19 vaccine for her 13-year-old daughter Janelle. While adults in their household are fully vaccinated, Edna is worried for her children. "Para mayroon na rin po siyang proteksiyon, kagaya po sa akin. Maganda pong nababakunahan na po kasi hindi po 100% na matatamaan na siya ng sakit." Janelle has also decided to get the vaccine once available. "Para po makalabas na din ako. Baka din po mahawaan ako ng may mga sakit." Almost 22% of the country's 110 million population got at least one dose of COVID- 19 vaccine. With the expected 114 million vaccine doses coming by October to December, the government has decided to inoculate the general population and the younger group next month. But the health department says considering the supply, the remaining unvaccinated adults and children at risk of getting severe infection are the priority. This means among the younger population, 12-17-year-olds with existing illness will get the vaccine first. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines will give a list of illnesses qualified for priority pediatric vaccination. And just like the inoculation of adults with comorbidity, there are requirements to prove that a child is sick. Maria Rosario Vergerie (Health Undersecretary): "Kailangan may medical clearance. It's either from their attending physicians or their specialists. Maaari naman po iyong doktor lang, iyong doktor natin doon sa kanilang local area pero magbibigay po tayo ng checklist." Myrna Cabotaje (Health Undersecretary/Nat' Vaccine Operations Center Chairperson): "Sa may mga medical complexity iyong may mga heart, sa respiratory, kidney at saka may mga iba-ibang problema." Both parents and children should also agree to the vaccination. Maria Rosario Vergerie (Health Undersecretary): "Kailangan din po natin na may guardian sila kapag pupunta sila doon sa may bakunahan." Only Pfizer and Moderna are allowed for age 12 to 17 in the Philippines. Vaccination among the younger population is expected to begin on October 15 in Metro Manila.

The Philippines reported 7,625 new coronavirus infections on Friday, among the lowest in two months. New cases fell to a daily average of 10.500 this month compared to nearly 19,000 in September. Jacquelyn Dannug, 40, said she wanted her child, 12, to have protection. "It would be difficult as we are often outside and she could possibly get infected if she is not fully vaccinated," said Dannug, standing beside her daughter.

                            16. Government to prioritize vaccination of adults, minors with health risks By Carolyn Bonquin I CNN Philippines 1 September 29, 2021 Edna Bautista wants a COVID-19 vaccine for her 13-year-old daughter Janelle. While adults in their household are fully vaccinated, Edna is worried for her children. "Para mayroon na rin po siyang proteksiyon, kagaya po sa akin. Maganda pong nababakunahan na po kasi hindi po 100% na matatamaan na siya ng sakit." Janelle has also decided to get the vaccine once available. "Para po makalabas na din ako. Baka din po mahawaan ako ng may mga sakit." Almost 22% of the country's 110 million population got at least one dose of COVID- 19 vaccine. With the expected 114 million vaccine doses coming by October to December, the government has decided to inoculate the general population and the younger group next month. But the health department says considering the supply, the remaining unvaccinated adults and children at risk of getting severe infection are the priority. This means among the younger population, 12-17-year-olds with existing illness will get the vaccine first. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines will give a list of illnesses qualified for priority pediatric vaccination. And just like the inoculation of adults with comorbidity, there are requirements to prove that a child is sick. Maria Rosario Vergerie (Health Undersecretary): "Kailangan may medical clearance. It's either from their attending physicians or their specialists. Maaari naman po iyong doktor lang, iyong doktor natin doon sa kanilang local area pero magbibigay po tayo ng checklist." Myrna Cabotaje (Health Undersecretary/Nat' Vaccine Operations Center Chairperson): "Sa may mga medical complexity iyong may mga heart, sa respiratory, kidney at saka may mga iba-ibang problema." Both parents and children should also agree to the vaccination. Maria Rosario Vergerie (Health Undersecretary): "Kailangan din po natin na may guardian sila kapag pupunta sila doon sa may bakunahan."

Other regions will follow after two weeks. Carolyn Bonquin, CNN Philippines. # Answer the questions based on the news report you listened to. 1. What is the news report mainly about? 2.

The last of the large woolly mammoths probably died out about 10,000 years ago. The Pleistocene was the last period in the <strong>Cenozoic era</strong>. ... During the Ice Age, mammoths died and were trapped in the ice.</p><p>3.<strong>The Cenozoic</strong> period began about 65 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs and continues through the present. ... During the last 65 million years, Pangea has broken up into the continents, and they have moved into the positions which we see them in now.</p><p>4.The dominant land animals were reptiles. The first dinosaurs, marine reptiles, lizards, and tortoises appeared. <strong>Mammal</strong>s appeared during the Triassic, but they remained insignificant until their competitors, the dinosaurs, became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.</p><p>5.Probably the most recognized mass extinction in the history of the Earth is called the K-T Extinction. This mass extinction event happened between the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era and the Tertiary Period of the <strong>Cenozoic Era</strong>. This was the mass extinction that took out the dinosaurs.</p><p>6.<strong>Paleontology</strong> is the study of the history of life on Earth as based on fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and single-celled living things that have been replaced by rock material or impressions of organisms preserved in rock.</p><p>7.This process — which is called <strong>carbonization, </strong>or distillation — yields a detailed carbon impression of the dead organism in sedimentary rock. ... After an organism's soft tissues decay in sediment, the hard parts — particularly the bones — are left behind.</p><p>8.The principle of <strong>superposition</strong> states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks</p><p>9.<strong>Trilobites</strong>, Hard-Shelled Invertebrates</p><p>10.Index fossil, any animal or plant preserved in the rock record of the Earth that is characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment.
