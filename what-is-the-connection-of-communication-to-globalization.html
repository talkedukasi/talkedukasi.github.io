                            19. what is the meaning of diversity, global business, morale, team building and visuals connect meaning of good communication? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The real meaning of diversity, global business, morale, team building and visuals in connection to good communication is that everytime we communicate, we must consider the above mentioned factors. First, when we say diversity, it refers to the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.
</p><p>Second, when we say global business we are then referring to international trade whereas a global business is a company doing business across the world. The exchange of goods over great distances goes back a very long time. Anthropologists have already established long-distance trading in Europe in the Stone Age. Sea-borne trading was commonplace in many regions of the world in times predating Greek civilization. Such trade, of course, was not by definition "global" but had the same characteristics. In the 16th century all of the continents came to be routinely linked by ocean-based communications. Trading activity in the modern sense rapidly followed at the beginning of the 17th century; it might be more accurate to say that it "returned" again because trading of such character had taken place in Roman times as well.  </p><p>Third, morale in good communication is the general spirit in the workplace or wherever we are tasked to communicate. It could be in church or in any other institution where we belong. When there is positive, two-way communication between managers and subordinates, and among co-workers, morale tends to be good.</p><p>Fourth, team building and visuals are always dependent on our openness with each other as we interact. Visuals refer to the symbols  we are using to convey our ideas, point of views or opinions. Visual communication is the practice of graphically representing information to efficiently, effectively create meaning. There are many types of content in the realm of visual communication, with examples including infographics, interactive content, motion graphics, and more.</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong></strong></p>(1)<p>There are many global problems that require urgent attention and solutions, some of them include:</p><p></p><strong>Climate change:</strong> The Earth's climate is changing at an alarming rate due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This is causing sea levels to rise, extreme weather events to become more frequent, and the loss of biodiversity. Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy sources, reducing carbon emissions, and investing in technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere.<p></p><strong>Poverty and inequality:</strong> Millions of people around the world live in extreme poverty and do not have access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, and healthcare. Solutions include increasing access to education and job training, providing microfinance to small businesses, and implementing progressive taxation systems.<p></p><strong>Global health:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a coordinated global response to health crises. Other global health issues include the spread of infectious diseases, lack of access to vaccines, and the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Solutions include investing in research and development of new treatments and vaccines, strengthening healthcare systems, and increasing access to healthcare.<p></p><strong>Human rights:</strong> Many people around the world are still facing discrimination, persecution, and violence based on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other factors. Solutions include implementing laws and policies to protect human rights, providing education and training to promote tolerance and understanding, and addressing the root causes of discrimination and violence.<p></p><strong>Global governance:</strong> The world is facing a number of interconnected challenges, and solutions will require cooperation and coordination among nations. Solutions include strengthening international organizations and agreements, such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and Paris Agreement, and promoting dialogue and cooperation among nations and other actors.<p></p><strong>Overpopulation:</strong> The world's population is increasing at a rapid rate, which is putting a strain on resources and contributing to environmental degradation. Solutions include increasing access to family planning services and education, and promoting sustainable development practices to reduce the global population.<p></p>(2)<p>There are several ways to improve and enhance internet connectivity, especially in areas with weak digital communication systems:</p><p></p><strong>Infrastructure development: </strong>Building more robust and reliable infrastructure, such as fiber-optic cables, cellular towers, and satellite networks, can help to improve internet connectivity in remote and under-served areas.<p></p><strong>Public-private partnerships:</strong> Governments and private companies can work together to expand internet access and improve connectivity. For example, governments can provide funding or tax incentives for companies to build infrastructure in rural areas, and companies can leverage their expertise and resources to deploy new technologies and services.<p></p><strong>Spectrum management:</strong> The efficient use and management of the radio spectrum can help to increase the capacity of wireless networks and improve connectivity. This can be done by allocating more spectrum for mobile services, implementing new technologies such as 5G, and by avoiding interference from other devices.<p></p><strong>Community networks:</strong> Community-based networks can be an effective way to provide internet access in remote or under-served areas. These networks are usually built and managed by local communities and can be a cost-effective solution for providing internet access.<p></p><strong>Wi-Fi hotspots:</strong> Public Wi-Fi hotspots can help to provide internet access in densely populated urban areas. This can be done by installing hotspots in public places such as parks, libraries, and public transportation stations.<p></p><strong>Invest in mobile network:</strong> Mobile networks can be a reliable solution for providing internet access in remote and under-served areas, by investing in 4G and 5G mobile networks can be a solution to improve digital communication systems.<p></p><strong>Government intervention:</strong> Government can provide subsidies to the ISPs to increase the coverage in under-served areas. Additionally, government can also invest in the research and development of new technologies that can improve internet connectivity.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization, roughly defined as the global integration of economies and societies,a affects many aspects of young peoples’ lives. Youth have an ambiguous relationship with the globalizing world, both economically and culturally. On the one hand, they are most flexible and perhaps best able to adapt to and make use of new opportunities offered. They are the best educated generation on new information technologies; they benefit from economic growth; many travel around the world for work, studies, exchange projects and vacation; and telephone and the Internet enable them to stay in touch with friends and relatives abroad. On the other hand, many youth, especially in developing countries, have been left out of the digitalization and modernization process and lack the economic power to benefit from the opportunities globalization offers.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Brainliest please. </p><p></p><br />
