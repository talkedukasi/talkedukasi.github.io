                                            Can you hear me now! Do you know that every year, 18.7 million of acres of forest is lost? That's more than 20 million football fields. So many forests are being cut down and it's making the planet sick and posing threat to life on Earth. Cutting down trees releases all the carbon dioxide they once stored. Carbon dioxide is a STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES greenhouse gas which traps heat from the Sun close to Earth's surface, causing global temperatures to rise and bringing about a process known as climate change. Fewer trees also mean less rainfall and more drought, and many more animals and plants will face extinction as their homes are destroyed. People can be taught the value of forests and the importance of caring for them and all life on planet earth. Being educated means to gather all the facts before making decision. We hope that the facts are considered before making a decision. We should all be responsible for taking good care of the earth.

                                            Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland. Though the Itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the searchcontinued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart wasdeclared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around theworld is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger de Saint-Exupery's LifeAntoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), a French writer and aviator.

He joined the French AirForce in 1921 and became a commercial pilot in 1926.9His first two books, Southern Mail (1929) and Night flight (1931), are novelsdistinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying, whichrequires devotion to duty at the risk of death. His later works, including Wind,Sand and Stars (1939), and Flight to Arras (1942), stress the humanisticPhilosophy of Saint-Exupery. His popular children's book The Little Prince (1943)is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning,During World War II, Saint-Exupery rejoined the French Air Force, was shot,escaped to the United States, and later joined the Free French Forces. On areconnaissance mission over southern France in 1944, his plane was lost. Theremains of the aircraft were not found until 2004 when scuba divers recovered atailpiece bearing the serial number of the aircraft Saint-Exupery was flying, aLockheed P-38 Lightning. The cause of the crash is still unknown. Saint-Exupery'snotebooks, collected under the title "Wisdom of the Sands" (1948), were publishedposthumously.​</a>

                                            Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden to distance himself from social life. The book tries to describe what it means to flourish as a human person.
We quote: “If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestion of his genius, which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, may it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevails over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs are more elastic, more starry, more immortal-that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gain and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched. …
I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of being. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty, nor weakness. If you have built castle in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundation under them.”
Having read the excerpts from Walden, do you think that this is comparable to Schumacher’s text on Buddhist Economics?

Read Published: September 13, 2019 It's only through mistakes we make We learn where we went wrong. It's only when we're far from home We realize where we belong. It's only when we close our eyes Our dreams seem clear and bright. It's only in our darkest hours We truly see the light. It's only when we lose our way We pray to the stars above.It's only through times of grief We learn the true meaning of love. It's only when all hope seems lost And our weary journey seems so far, When all the world's against you, We learn how strong we really are. All things are sent to try us. We must strive and give our best. I believe God is watching over us, And he guides us in our quest. ​</a>

Write your answer on your paper. 1. A lot of people use drug illegal drugs because they find that it's the easy way to sort out their problems clearly. That's why you should treat your patients in a clear way. That means you should treat your patients in a way that helps them to tell the difference between their problems and find ways to deal with them. 2. I believe that Alexander Flemming invented antibiotics in 1928. And I learned that antibiotics are made up of chemical substances being produced by lots of microorganisms and other living systems. Antibiotics are capable of stopping the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. 3. Lots of people celebrate Halloween. Halloween is a contraction from the phrase "All Hallows Even". It's a Catholic holiday, but today, I know it's more about trick-or-treating, scary costumes, or funny pranks. It's lost it's religious meaning.​</a>

                            5. Can you hear me now! Do you know that every year, 18.7 million of acres of forest is lost? That's more than 20 million football fields. So many forests are being cut down and it's making the planet sick and posing threat to life on Earth. Cutting down trees releases all the carbon dioxide they once stored. Carbon dioxide is a STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES greenhouse gas which traps heat from the Sun close to Earth's surface, causing global temperatures to rise and bringing about a process known as climate change. Fewer trees also mean less rainfall and more drought, and many more animals and plants will face extinction as their homes are destroyed. People can be taught the value of forests and the importance of caring for them and all life on planet earth. Being educated means to gather all the facts before making decision. We hope that the facts are considered before making a decision. We should all be responsible for taking good care of the earth.

                            6. Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland. Though the Itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the searchcontinued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart wasdeclared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around theworld is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger de Saint-Exupery's LifeAntoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), a French writer and aviator. He wasborn in Lyon and educated at the University of Fribourg. He joined the French AirForce in 1921 and became a commercial pilot in 1926.9His first two books, Southern Mail (1929) and Night flight (1931), are novelsdistinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying, whichrequires devotion to duty at the risk of death. His later works, including Wind,Sand and Stars (1939), and Flight to Arras (1942), stress the humanisticPhilosophy of Saint-Exupery. His popular children's book The Little Prince (1943)is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning,During World War II, Saint-Exupery rejoined the French Air Force, was shot,escaped to the United States, and later joined the Free French Forces. On areconnaissance mission over southern France in 1944, his plane was lost. Theremains of the aircraft were not found until 2004 when scuba divers recovered atailpiece bearing the serial number of the aircraft Saint-Exupery was flying, aLockheed P-38 Lightning. The cause of the crash is still unknown. Saint-Exupery'snotebooks, collected under the title "Wisdom of the Sands" (1948), were publishedposthumously.​</h2><br />

                            8. Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden to distance himself from social life. The book tries to describe what it means to flourish as a human person.
We quote: “If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestion of his genius, which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, may it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevails over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs are more elastic, more starry, more immortal-that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gain and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched. …
I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of being. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty, nor weakness. If you have built castle in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundation under them.”

Both works share a common theme of living a simple life that is in harmony with nature and emphasizes the importance of self-sufficiency and community.</p><p></p><p>While Walden is more of a personal account of Thoreau’s experience living in the woods, Schumacher’s Buddhist Economics is an essay that explores the idea of an economics of peace and envisions a world where people live in self-sufficient villages that work together in peace and cooperation1.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps! </p><br />

                            11. Activity 1: Rewrite the Stars! Read and study each of the paragraphs below then re-write it in a more academic style of writing. Write your answer on your paper. 1. A lot of people use drug illegal drugs because they find that it's the easy way to sort out their problems clearly. That's why you should treat your patients in a clear way. That means you should treat your patients in a way that helps them to tell the difference between their problems and find ways to deal with them. 2. I believe that Alexander Flemming invented antibiotics in 1928. And I learned that antibiotics are made up of chemical substances being produced by lots of microorganisms and other living systems. Antibiotics are capable of stopping the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. 3. Lots of people celebrate Halloween. Halloween is a contraction from the phrase "All Hallows Even". It's a Catholic holiday, but today, I know it's more about trick-or-treating, scary costumes, or funny pranks. It's lost it's religious meaning.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Illicit drug use is often perceived as a quick solution to personal problems, thus it is important for healthcare professionals to provide clear and effective treatment that enables patients to differentiate between underlying issues and identify appropriate coping strategies.</p><p></p><p>2.The discovery of antibiotics is commonly attributed to Alexander Fleming in 1928. Antibiotics are composed of chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and living systems, and are capable of inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and viruses.</p><p></p><p>3.The celebration of Halloween has become a popular cultural phenomenon, despite its origin as a Catholic holiday known as "All Hallows Even." Although the holiday has lost much of its religious connotation, it continues to be associated with trick-or-treating, costumes, and pranks.</p><br />

                            15. PHAETHON was a youthful son of Helios who begged his father let him drive thechariot of the sun. The god reluctantly conceded to the boy's wishes and handed himthe reigns. But his inexperience proved fatal, for Phaethon quickly lost control of theimmortal steeds and the sun-chariot veered out of control setting the earth ablaze. Theplains of Africa were scorched to desert and men charred black. Zeus, appalled by thedestruction, smote the boy with a thunderbolt, hurling his flaming body into the watersof the River Eridanos. Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, gathered on the banks and intheir mourning were transformed into amber-teared poplar trees.After his death Phaethon was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Auriga("the Charioteer"), or else transformed into the god of the star which the Greeksnamed Phaeth on--the planet Jupiter or SaturnThe name Phaethon means "the shining" or "radiant one from the Greekverb phaethó "to shine."FAMILY OF PHAETHONPARENTS(1.1) HELIOS(1.2) HELIOS &amp; KLYMENE(1.31 KLYMENOS &amp; MEROPE(PHAETHON - Son of the Sun-God of Greek Mythology 2017)Now answer the questions for processing!1.
