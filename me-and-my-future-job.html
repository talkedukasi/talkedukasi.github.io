                                            write a story which relates the events of your life from past, present and future to the life cycle of a star. use also those elements which could symbolize something or anything in your story.THIS IS MY ANWERMaking our dreams a reality is quite impossible for those who dream. In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

                                            Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them.

                            22. Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.
