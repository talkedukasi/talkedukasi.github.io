Which example has particles that can be drawn closer to occupy smaller volume?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>C. air inside the syringe</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>The air inside the syringe although not seen can be felt. Try blocking the syringe air passage and you will be able to feel that you can not push the syringe further. This is because the air particles are already being compressed together.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>2. Which of the following phenomena does NOT involve the application of gas pressure? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>b. falling leaves</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p><p>When a leaf fall there is only minimal air resistance that is acting upon the leaf. That's why Falling leaf is an example of a freely falling object that the only force affects it is gravity.</p><p></p><p>
3. ...What is the probable explanation for the blown out tire during a long summer drive? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p>D. The volume of gases increases as the temperature increases, causing a blown up tire.
</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>This can be explained with Charle's Law that as Temperature increases, Volume increases. The continues friction that is acted upon the tire of the car caused the rise in temperature to the tire. Also take note that the scenario illustrated is during the summer.</p><p></p><p>4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How does volume affect pressure?</p><p>Volume and Pressure: Boyle's Law</p><p>Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>[tex]_____________________________________[/tex]</p><p>[tex]\large\sf\pink{Answer:}[/tex]</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>C</p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>B</p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>B</p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>C</p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>D</p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>A</p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>C</p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>D</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>A</p><p></p><p>[tex]_____________________________________[/tex]</p><p>#❥BrainliestBunch</p><p>#I want Help to each other ^_^</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
