                        The moral of Shirley Jackson's Lottery seems connected to society's awareness of the tradition's danger. We need to remind ourselves that just there is a norm, something that has been done in traditional ways, it doesn't mean we should close our door for new ways, new systems, especially if this something new is much better, more humane and an outstandingly effective way to deal with our predicaments.<br /><br />Shirley Jackson wrote this story during the era when communism  and socialism were feared by most society and the historical context in which dropping of bombs against other nation and having some concentration camp were being appreciated. Her story targeted those people who will only speak up if and only if they are being directly affected by social issues.<strong><br /></strong><br />

</p>What is the theme or the lesson in the story "the lottery"?
<p>  </p>The lottery, "says <strong>Shirley Jackson, </strong>reflects the notion of the <strong>scapegoat</strong> as someone who is blamed on  the evils of society and exiled of order to eradicate sin and facilitate the <strong>rehabilitation</strong> of the community.
<p>
</p>There seems to be <strong>tradition</strong>  in the theme of the novel.  By upholding their custom, the  villagers use someone as a sacrifice.  The townspeople are able to survive and govern their  lives through an ancient tradition and how they die.  The family were also a subject, and the emotional  link between the family was totally insignificant during the lotery.  The family members of Hutchinson did not try to avoid  the custom of the city to save one of their relatives.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction
</p><p>“The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson is a short story published in the June 26, 1948 edition of The New Yorker. Written immediately after World War II, it explores ideas such as communal violence, individual vulnerability, and the dangers of blindly following tradition. Set in a fictional town in mid 20th-century America, the story begins as a straightforward tale about a small town’s annual lottery. By the end, it evolves into a horror story featuring the public stoning of the lottery's winner. Told from an objective, third-person point of view, the plot is advanced primarily by dialogue but is also full of symbols and allusions that enhance its themes  Plot Summary
</p><p>Around ten o’clock in the morning on June 27, all the residents of a small town gather in the town square for an annual lottery. The children arrive first and begin playing games and collecting stones. Bobby Martin, Dickie Delacroix, and Harry Jones form a pile of the stones in a corner of the square. The adults of the town arrive soon after. The mothers call their children to come stand with their families. Bobby Martin, who was the first child to start collecting stones, joins his family reluctantly.
</p><p>
</p><p>Joe Summers, a childless man with a nag for a wife, conducts the lottery every year because he has the “time and energy to devote to civic activities.” He arrives carrying a black, wooden box. Mr. Graves, the postmaster, arrives with him, carrying a stool. Mr. Summers places the box on the stool and the townspeople keep their distance from it. The box has grown worn with age, and Mr. Summers often suggests making a new one. His suggestion has thus far been ignored, since the townspeople are wary of breaking with tradition. However, Mr. Summers did convince the town to agree to fill the box with paper slips instead of the more traditional wood chips on account of the growing population.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Before the lottery can start, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves must make lists denoting the heads of families and households in the town. They also list the members of each household. Mr. Graves then swears Mr. Summers in as the official of the lottery. Some of the townspeople recall that there used to be other rituals. However, they cannot agree on the exact details of most of the rituals, because most of them have changed or been discarded over time. Just as Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves are about to begin the lottery, Tessie Hutchinson rushes into the square. She says that she forgot what day it was but rushed to the square as soon as she remembered. After being reassured that the lottery has not yet started, Tessie joins her family.
</p><p>
</p><p>After Tessie settles in, Mr. Summers asks the crowd if everyone has arrived. Mr. Dunbar, who broke his leg, is absent. His wife agrees to draw for him since they do not have any sons old enough to do it. Mr. Summers asks if the Watson boy will be drawing for his family, and he nervously affirms. Mr. Summers then checks to make sure that Old Man Warner, the town’s oldest resident, arrived to the square. After verifying that everyone is in attendance, Mr. Summers says the lottery can begin.
</p><p>
</p><p>Mr. Summers goes over the rules of the lottery: the head of each family draws a slip of paper, and no one is to look at their slip until everyone else has drawn. Most of the townspeople...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The story "The Lottery Ticket" by Anton Chekhov has a moral lesson about the dangers of greed and how it can ruin relationships. The story revolves around a couple, Ivan and Masha, who get excited when they think they have won the lottery. They begin to daydream about all the things they could buy and the luxurious lifestyle they could have. However, as the story progresses and the possibility of winning becomes less certain, their happiness turns into disappointment and frustration, and they start to resent each other.</p><p></p><p>The moral of the story is that material possessions and wealth do not bring true happiness, and that greed can lead to bitterness and broken relationships. Instead, the story suggests that people should focus on the love and companionship they have in their lives, rather than obsessing over money and possessions. It also highlights the importance of communication and honesty in relationships, as Ivan and Masha's lack of communication and trust ultimately leads to their downfall.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The PCSO Lottery Draw is a Philippine television game show produced by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO).</p><p><strong>What is the usual use of lottery in the Philippines? in the Lottery by Shirley Jackson</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the lottery is often used as a form of gambling. It is a popular activity, with many people buying lottery tickets in hopes of winning big prizes. In the United States, the lottery is often used as a means of raising money for state governments and public services. In the short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson, the lottery is used as a means of enforcing a brutal tradition in a small town. In the story, the townspeople hold a lottery each year and select one person to be sacrificed for the good of the community. This use of the lottery is clearly meant to be a critique of the dangers of blindly following tradition and the potential for violence within a community.</p><p></p><p><strong>How about in the story? What is the use of lottery? in the Lottery by Shirley Jackson</strong></p><p>In the short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson, the lottery is used as a means of enforcing a brutal tradition in a small town. Each year, the town holds a lottery and selects one person to be sacrificed for the good of the community. This use of the lottery is meant to be a critique of the dangers of blindly following tradition and the potential for violence within a community. The story does not suggest that this is the typical or usual use of a lottery. Instead, it is a specific example of how a seemingly benign activity can be used to support a destructive and violent practice.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the prize of the person being selected in the lottery? in the Lottery by Shirley Jackson</strong></p><p>In the short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson, the prize for the person who is selected in the lottery is not specified. The story does not mention any specific prize or reward for the person who is selected. Instead, the focus is on the shock and horror of the townspeople when they realize that one of their own will be sacrificed. The story suggests that the townspeople participate in the lottery each year out of a sense of tradition and obedience, rather than for the promise of any particular prize. The person who is selected in the lottery is ultimately stoned to death by the other members of the community, indicating that the true "prize" of the lottery is a violent and gruesome death.</p><p></p><p><strong> Is the tradition worth hanging to? Why or Why not? in The Lottery by Shirley Jackson</strong></p><p>It is not clear whether the tradition in "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson is worth hanging onto. The story does not provide any information about the reasons behind the tradition or its potential benefits. Instead, it presents the tradition as a brutal and violent practice that ultimately leads to the death of one of the townspeople. The story suggests that the townspeople participate in the lottery each year out of a sense of obedience and tradition, rather than because they believe it serves any useful purpose. The ending of the story implies that the tradition is not worth hanging onto, as it serves no real purpose and leads to unnecessary violence and suffering. Ultimately, whether the tradition is worth hanging onto is a matter of personal interpretation and perspective.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the lesson of the story? in The Lottery by Shirley Jackson</strong></p><p>The lesson of "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson is that blindly following tradition can be dangerous and lead to violent consequences. The story presents a small town where the people participate in a yearly lottery that ultimately leads to the death of one of their own. The story suggests that the townspeople participate in the lottery out of a sense of obedience and tradition, without questioning the reasons behind it or the potential consequences. The ending of the story implies that the tradition serves no real purpose and only leads to unnecessary violence and suffering. The lesson of the story is that it is important to question tradition and consider the potential harm that it can cause, rather than blindly following it without thought or consideration.</p><p></p><p>I dont know if this is what you need</p><br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p>Be <strong>fair</strong>, the people of the village certainly must believe that violence  is wrong; the people of the village also feel rational and peaceful enough.
<p>
</p><strong>Shirley Jackson's Lottery morality</strong> seems to be <strong>connected</strong>  with <strong>society's awareness</strong> of the <strong>danger</strong> of the <strong>tradition</strong>.  We need to note that there is only one standard, something that has been done in <strong>conventional ways,</strong> it doesn't mean that we can shut our  door to new methods , new systems, particularly if this new method is much better, more <strong>humane</strong>, and an <strong>incredibly successful</strong> way of coping with our <strong>predicaments</strong>.
<p>
</p>Shirley Jackson wrote this story during the period when much of society hated communism and socialism and the  historical sense in which it was admired to drop bombs on another country and to have some concentration camps.  Her story addressed certain individuals who would only talk if  and only if they are specifically impacted by social problems.
