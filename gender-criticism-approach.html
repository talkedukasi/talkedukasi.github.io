Historical-Biographical. This approach sees a literary work as a reflection of the author's life and times or the life and times of the characters in the work. 15. Moral-Philosophical. This approach takes the position that the larger function of literature is to teach morality and probe philosophical issues, such as ethics, religion, or the nature of humanity. 16. Formalistic Criticism. Using this type of criticism, a reader would see the work as an independent and self-sufficient artistic object. This approach is also sometimes referred to as the “New Criticism," since it came back in vogue in the 1960s-70s, but it was originally an outgrowth of the "Ant for Art's Sake" movement of the late 1800s. 17. Sociological / Marxist Criticism. This approach asks us to use a wide variety of issues related to gender, concerning the author, the work itself, the reader, and the societies of the author and reader, to determine the stance of the work on the feminist continuum. 18. Feminist / Gender Criticism. This viewpoint considers particular aspects of the political content of the text, the author, the historical and socio-cultural context of the work, and the cultural, political, and personal situation of the reader in relationship to the text.​</h2><br />

                            22. in what ways can the feminist approach in literary criticism help us better understand the representation of gender and the experiences of women in literature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The feminist approach in literary criticism can help us better understand how gender is represented and constructed in literature, and how this representation reflects and reinforces cultural norms and power relations. By examining the portrayal of female characters, feminist critics can uncover the ways in which women are often marginalized, objectified, or stereotyped in literature. They can also explore how women's experiences and perspectives are often overlooked or misrepresented, and how this can perpetuate patriarchal attitudes and values.</p><p></p><p>Feminist literary criticism can also help us understand the historical and social context in which literature is produced and received, and how this context shapes the representation of gender. For example, feminist critics can analyze the ways in which literary works respond to or challenge social and political movements such as the women's suffrage movement or the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s. They can also examine the ways in which literary works reflect or resist dominant cultural myths and ideologies about women, such as the idea of the "angel in the house" or the "femme fatale."</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, feminist literary criticism can help us recognize the diversity of women's experiences and identities, and the ways in which these experiences intersect with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality. By examining the representation of women from different backgrounds and perspectives, feminist critics can challenge essentialist and stereotypical notions of femininity, and promote a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of gender and identity in literature.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p>The text "All these Fighting Cocks" can be interpreted through a gender criticism lens, as it explores the toxic masculinity and violence associated with cockfighting. The narrator, a young boy, is eager to prove his masculinity by participating in the violent sport, despite his mother's disapproval. The male characters in the story view the roosters as extensions of themselves, and derive pleasure from the brutal fights.</p><p></p><p>Through a psychological criticism approach, the story can be seen as a depiction of the effects of toxic masculinity on young boys. The narrator idolizes his father and grandfather, who are both involved in cockfighting, and feels the need to prove himself to them. The violent nature of the sport also serves as an outlet for the emotions that the male characters struggle to express in a healthy manner.</p><p></p><p>From a sociological criticism perspective, the story highlights the cultural significance of cockfighting in certain communities. The rural setting and the men's devotion to the sport can be seen as a representation of the traditions and values that are deeply ingrained in certain regions. The story also brings to light the issue of animal cruelty and the ethical implications of participating in this type of activity.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "All these Fighting Cocks" portrays the harmful effects of toxic masculinity and the cultural significance of certain traditions, while also shedding light on the issue of animal cruelty.</p><br />
