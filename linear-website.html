We can include all information that we found to our research to make our document thick when printed. 5. We need to do preliminary research for our topic.6. Nonlinear text is sequential. 7. Nonlinear texts can show large quantity of information in just a glance.8. Reading a linear text does not require time to read.9. In transferring information from linear to nonlinear text, reading the whole text is needed to get the general idea of the topic.10. Visuals presented may be converted to a linear text. 11. It is important to write an overview or main idea when interpreting a nonlinear text. 12. Writing key features in a linear text is not that necessary.13. Histogram is a linear text. 14.

Performance Standard: The learner is able to solve polynomials, rational algebraic expressions, linear equations and inequalities in two variables, systems of Competency (1) Illustrates the rectangular coordinate system and its uses. (2) Illustrates linear equations in two variables. (3) Illustrates and finds the slope of a line given two points, equation, and graph. (4) Writes the linear equation ax + by = c in the form y = mx + b and vice versa. (5) (6) Describes the graph of a linear equation in terms of its intercepts and slope. Graphs a linear equation given (a) any two points; (b) the x- and y-intercepts; (c) the slope and a point on the line. Task Description: (Problem Set) In this unit you have learned how to solve real-life problems involving linear equation in two variables and slope of a line. Task: The learner will answer the problem set given. Solve the following. 1. A new website has 10 hits in the first day, and every day after that it gets 5 more hits. Write an modeling the number of hits the website gets and graph the equation. 2. Melbert decides to shop around for the best price. A different newspaper charges Php14 for the first 3 lines, and then Php2 for each line after that. Write an equation in point-slope form.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Linear means something related to a line. All the linear equations are used to construct a line. A non-linear equation is such which does not form a straight line. It looks like a curve in a graph and has a variable slope value.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The key difference between linear and nonlinear text is their reading path. In a linear text, a reader can make sense of the text by reading sequentially, from beginning to the end. However, in a nonlinear text, the reading path is nonlinear and non-sequential; thus, the reader can choose his own reading path.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
