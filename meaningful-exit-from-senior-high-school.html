                                            hChoosing the Right Path           Decisions and choices are the things that set senior high school apart from junior high school. Graduates have shared that deciding on the strand/track to take is just the beginning of creating choices. As we move to the next level, more critical choices are made. Entering Grade 12 marks the next crucial step in life - choosing the curricular exit. Curricular exits are the paths that learners take after they finish their senior high school. These exits include higher education, middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment. The decisions and choices to be made would rely on numerous factors like the resources and priorities. Senior high school may not be not college yet and not junior high school, but it is the important period in choosing the right path. - Cindy Sicat, Eastern Porac NHS1.

                            1. My meaningful Exit from Senior High School</h2><br />
                        Senior High School
<p>
</p>Senior high school would be easy if we make it easy and it would also be hard at the same time if we make it challenging. <p></p><p>For me, it was a mix of fun, sad, easy and challenging all at the same time. This is the time wherein I am about to fully decide the path that I would want to go as I am about to begin the next chapter of my life. I had so much fun during my senior year because of the experiences that I have gained and the accomplishments I achieved. I also felt sad as I am about to go to a different chapter in my life and there would be chances that the people that I have been with would also go to different places and I might not see them anymore like I normally do every day in school. I even cried during the graduation day as some will be studying outside the country and we need to bid our goodbyes.  </p><p>
</p><p>I also find it easy compared to the years when I first started. I have great teachers that helped me become better and understand the importance of education. I was also challenged at the same time because I will finally be more independent and have to choose the course that I will be taking up in college. It was hard at first if you really do not know what you want.  </p><p>
</p><p>What I did, I ask my parents if they have any suggestions of the perfect course to take in college and even asked them how it is to be a college student. The reason why I did that is to prepare myself and somehow get ideas from their experience.  </p><p>
</p><p>Senior year was my favorite year above all – I experienced how great prom is, even get the chance to dance with my friends. Also, that was the first time that my parents allowed me to go out with my friends and had fun with the after party.
</p><p>
</p><p>Senior year made me become more confident with myself. I can say that I was able to develop and discovered my strengths and my weaknesses. It helped me more to know what I want to be in life and to know my purpose. Our school even provided us an event and invited different successful people to share their knowledge and give us tips on how to become successful in life. These individuals really helped us to be more determined and to strive hard to reach our goals.  </p><p>
</p><p>Life indeed is not that easy. The moment we get out and face the real world, we need to be strong and determined to be able to survive. There would be a lot of challenges that we never get to understand yet until we get to experience it ourselves. So, I am really grateful enough that I was able to gain all the knowledge and strength during my senior year and finally decided the path that I want to take in college.

Here are some of the struggles they may face:</p><p></p><p>Social anxiety: After being isolated and working independently for so long, students may feel anxious about going back to a social environment. They may have difficulty connecting with their classmates and teachers, especially if they are new to the school or class.</p><p></p><p>Learning in a new environment: Students may feel disoriented in a new physical setting and may need time to adjust to the new learning environment. They may need to get used to new classrooms, schedules, and routines.</p><p></p><p>Distractions: In a traditional classroom setting, there may be more distractions such as noise, other students, or even the physical classroom itself. Students may find it difficult to focus and concentrate on their studies.</p><p></p><p>Time management: Students may need to adjust their time management skills to accommodate the new schedule and workload. They may need to prioritize their tasks and assignments differently from what they were used to during online classes.</p><p></p><p>Increased workload: In some cases, students may be given more work to do in a face-to-face setting than they were during online classes. This can be overwhelming for some students, especially if they are also dealing with the other challenges mentioned above.</p><p></p><p>It's important for teachers and parents to support students during this transition period by providing guidance and resources to help them adjust to the new learning environment.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The grading system in Junior High school goes like this 20% for the final examinations, 40% for written tests and 40% for the performance task, some subjects in Junior High School have a different grading system like for example, 20% final examinations, 35% written works then 45% for the performance tasks. . There are some subjects in Junior High School that have a different grading system like for example, 20% final examinations, 35% written works then 45% for the performance tasks As you can see in Junior High School, the performance task would always hold the highest percentage in every subject, while in Senior High the grading system differs from the kind of subject, per each strand they have this what you call the specialized subjects, applied subjects and the core subjects. In Senior High, written works can have the highest percentage depending on the requirements of the subject.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>For the core subjects like Statistics, the grading system is like this 35% for written works, 35% for performance task and 30% for final exams (prelims, midterms and finals).The specialized subjects such as business ethics, the grading system is like this 25% for written works, 45% for performance task and 30% for final exams. While for applied subjects like Pagsulat, the grading system is like this 30% for both written works and final exams then for performance task its 40%.

                            29. hChoosing the Right Path           Decisions and choices are the things that set senior high school apart from junior high school. Graduates have shared that deciding on the strand/track to take is just the beginning of creating choices. As we move to the next level, more critical choices are made. Entering Grade 12 marks the next crucial step in life - choosing the curricular exit. Curricular exits are the paths that learners take after they finish their senior high school. These exits include higher education, middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment. The decisions and choices to be made would rely on numerous factors like the resources and priorities. Senior high school may not be not college yet and not junior high school, but it is the important period in choosing the right path. - Cindy Sicat, Eastern Porac NHS1.
