When people are interested in exploring a problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a 1. ________________. In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the one that the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________ variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. Tomeasure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14. ________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. PA HELP PO HUHU​</a>

                        LAMARCKISM<p></p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<p></p>1. Give an example of an organism that can possibly support the theory of acquired trait. Describe why this organism supports the theory.<p></p><p>The best and most used example of Lamarck's theory of acquired trait, can be seen in <strong>Giraffes</strong>. Lamarck believed that the most used characteristic of an animal evolved through time because of the environment and needs. Just like in <strong>Giraffe, where they developed longer necks to reach the leaves on the branches of higher trees, since they are herbivorous animals. </strong></p><p></p>2. Do you agree or disagree with Lamarck's Theory of Acquired Traits? Support your answer.<p></p><p>I somehow agree with Lamarck, because his theory is a bit related to adaptation, and according to theory evolution characteristics of animals really change depending on their environment, and <strong>this is what makes them survive for many many years to come. </strong></p><p></p><p>If an animal failed to adapt with the changes in the environment, then that animal will probably go extinct very soon. </p><p></p>3. What factor did you consider in agreeding or disagreeding with Lamarck's theories?<p></p><p>Because it seemed real and possible to happen, after all if a theory <strong>aligns with the actual world and evidences, that would make it agreeable. </strong>Also, adaptation is really happening in the biosphere, so the theory of Lamarck is acceptable. </p><p></p><p></p><p>#BrainliestBunch</p><br />

To measure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14.________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. pa help sa magaling dyan.. mas maganda ma perfect :)​</h2><br />

In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the one that the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________ variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. Tomeasure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition.
