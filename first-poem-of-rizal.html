                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1 Jose Rizal's poem and story written at the age of 8 are remarkable achievements for a child of that age. The poem "Sa Aking Mga Kababata" reflects the author's deep sense of patriotism and love for his motherland. The story "Ang Pagong at ang Matsing" showcases Rizal's creativity and storytelling skills.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2 The poem "Sa Aking Mga Kababata" is considered historically authentic in terms of reflecting the sentiment of the Filipino people during the Spanish colonial period. The poem speaks of the importance of language and education in the preservation of Filipino identity and culture. This message is consistent with Rizal's later writings and advocacy for social reforms and national liberation. However, it is important to note that the actual authorship of the poem has been disputed, and there are some who argue that it was not written by Rizal but by another author. Nevertheless, the message and themes of the poem align with Rizal's views and ideas.</strong></p><p></p><br />

The poem and its accompanying story provide insight into Rizal's early life and his admiration for his mother's love and sacrifices. My first impression of the piece is that it is a touching tribute to a mother's unwavering devotion, which is conveyed through poignant imagery and heartfelt language. It is remarkable that Rizal was able to produce such a powerful work at such a young age, and it highlights his natural gift for writing. Overall, "My First Inspiration" is a beautiful piece of literature that demonstrates the depth of Rizal's talent, even from a young age.</strong></p><p></p><br />
