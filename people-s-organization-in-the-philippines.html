                                            The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</a>

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                            13. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.
