                            1. a martian sends a postcard home</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A Martian Sends a Postcard Home<p>Craig Raine (1979)</p><p></p><p>Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings</p><p>and some are treasured for their markings–</p><p></p><p>they cause the eyes to melt</p><p>or the body to shriek without pain.</p><p></p><p>I have never seen one fly, but</p><p>sometimes they perch on the hand.</p><p></p><p>("The object that the Martian sees in the 1st and 6th lines in the poem is a "Book")</p><p></p><p>Mist is when the sky is tired of flight</p><p>and rests its soft machine on ground:</p><p></p><p>then the world is dim and bookish</p><p>like engravings under tissue paper.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 7th and 10th lines in the poem is a "Mist")</p><p></p><p>Rain is when the earth is television.</p><p>It has the property of making colours darker.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 11st and 12th lines in the poem is a "Rain")</p><p></p><p>Model T is a room with the lock inside –</p><p>a key is turned to free the world</p><p></p><p>for movement, so quick there is a film</p><p>to watch for anything missed.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 13t and 16th lines in the poem is a "Automobile/Car")</p><p></p><p>But time is tied to the wrist</p><p>or kept in a box, ticking with impatience.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 17th and 18th lines in the poem is a "Wristwatch")</p><p></p><p>In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps,</p><p>that snores when you pick it up.</p><p></p><p>If the ghost cries, they carry it</p><p>to their lips and soothe it to sleep</p><p></p><p>with sounds. And yet, they wake it up</p><p>deliberately, by tickling with a finger.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 19th and 24th lines in the poem is a "Telephone")</p><p></p><p>Only the young are allowed to suffer</p><p>openly. Adults go to a punishment room</p><p></p><p>with water but nothing to eat.</p><p>They lock the door and suffer the noises</p><p></p><p>alone. No one is exempt</p><p>and everyone’s pain has a different smell.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 25t and 30th lines in the poem is a "Bathroom/Toilet")</p><p></p><p>At night, when all the colours die,</p><p>they hide in pairs</p><p></p><p>and read about themselves –</p><p>in colour, with their eyelids shut.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 31th and 34th lines in the poem is a "Sleeping People/2 persons sleeping in one bed")</p><p></p>Explanation:<p></p><p><strong>Book</strong> - Because a book looks likes a bird, when it flaps. Because a bird has a left and right wings. And also a Book it has left and right pages, when you open it. And the pages is looks like a feather. And a book has also a markings on it. And the book will come up to our hands.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mist</strong> - Because the Martian said that a sky is tired of flight and rest on ground. So when we think that the sky is tired and rest on the ground. So we must probably think that, the sky will go down in the ground. And it looks like a fog or a mist.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rain</strong> - Because once it rains, you will probably get an umbrella and use it. So when you use the umbrella. The shaddow of the umbrella was describing to the Martian, about "property of making colours darker." Because the surface will became darker because of the shadow of the umbrella. Because their is a rain occur. So we use umbrella.</p><p></p><p><strong>Automobile/Car</strong> - A Model T refers to an "automobile" because a car has a lock inside and it looks like a room, because their is a door and window and also seated chairs. And "a film" refers to a rearview mirror, because once the car is moving or starting forward. Once you see the rearview mirror, while driving. It looks like a film because it's moving backwards and anything missed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Wristwatch</strong>- Because wristwatch is a time that it looks like tied by a wrist. And it also ticking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Telephone</strong> - The martian said that " that snores when you pick up". Snore means "ringing" so once a tellephone rings, we will pick up. And we will carry it and directly to the lips. In order to talk to the caller on the telephone.</p><p></p><p><strong>Bathroom/Toilet</strong> - Because punishment room refers to a "bathroom". And we also bring water. Suffer reffers to "pooping". And the pain refers to "pooping while your face is looks like crumpled", because when we pain also, our face looks liked crumpled. And different smell refers to "smells bad because of poop."</p><p></p><p><strong>Sleeping People</strong> - Because it's night time. And also when our eyelids shut, we are like sleeping. And they "hide in pairs" refers to a 2 people/couple that was fully blanket when they sleep. </p><br />

                        The poem, A Martian Sends a Postcard Home, talks about an Martian alien that describes and compares everyday things in weird manner because of the lack of a particular word or concept to a particular thing it saw. The lesson of the poem may lie in the poem’s description of what humans do and have, which were all bluntly described by the alien.<br />

                            13. Things that are describe in the Poem A martian send a postcard home</h2><br />
                        <strong>A Martian sends a postcard home</strong><p>The poem  A <strong>Martian </strong>sends a postcard home described the following things:
</p>Books
Phones
Cars
Sleeping people
Wristwatch
Mist
Rain
Bathroom
<p>The poem was about a <strong>Martian </strong>who visits the Earth and notices different things that are truly new to him and his senses. It is as if he was purely innocent of how things exist but knows how it works. He mostly described things that are both natural and some are technological inventions that we acquired for some time.
</p>Books- the <strong>Martian</strong> called them Caxtons like the inventor of the printing press William Caxton or mechanical birds. It has a lot of wings which are the pages and he didn’t saw it even once fly as he expected a bird would do.
Phones- he described it as a ghost or a haunted apparatus that needs soothing of our voice which actually represents us picking it up and answering a call when it rings. And we also use it or wake it up by calling someone else as the conversation starter.  Cars- he called it Model T which is locked on the inside and requires a key for it to starts moving across roads or places. Like when a car needs ignition, and the mirrors attached on the car was described as a film to watch whenever you miss something along the way.
Sleeping People- when the night falls and the sky is darker people come to their beds and sleep. There he described it as going into pairs when the colors die. He also mentioned “us” reading ourselves since our eye moves even when we sleep as if we were reading.
Wristwatch-he described it as time tied to our wrist, which makes it more accessible than carrying huge clocks to tell the time.
Mist- he described it as when the sky gets tired it rest on the ground and makes the world less colorful and hazy.
Rain-he described it as television with fewer colors present and displays grainy images much darker than usual.
Bathroom- a punishment room where adults go to suffer alone, he also described that only the young are allowed to suffer out in the open. It is the same as doing business in the bathroom and locking the door to get some peace. He also said something about every people’s pain smells different.

And yet, they wake it up</p><p>deliberately, by tickling with a finger.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 19th and 24th lines in the poem is a "Telephone")</p><p></p><p>Only the young are allowed to suffer</p><p>openly. Adults go to a punishment room</p><p></p><p>with water but nothing to eat.</p><p>They lock the door and suffer the noises</p><p></p><p>alone. No one is exempt</p><p>and everyone’s pain has a different smell.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 25t and 30th lines in the poem is a "Bathroom/Toilet")</p><p></p><p>At night, when all the colours die,</p><p>they hide in pairs</p><p></p><p>and read about themselves –</p><p>in colour, with their eyelids shut.</p><p></p><p> ("The object that the Martian sees in the 31th and 34th lines in the poem is a "Sleeping People/2 persons sleeping in one bed")</p><p></p><p></p>Explanation:<p></p><p>Book - Because a book looks likes a bird, when it flaps. Because a bird has a left and right wings. And also a Book it has left and right pages, when you open it. And the pages is looks like a feather. And a book has also a markings on it. And the book will come up to our hands.</p><p></p><p>Mist - Because the Martian said that a sky is tired of flight and rest on ground. So when we think that the sky is tired and rest on the ground. So we must probably think that, the sky will go down in the ground. And it looks like a fog or a mist.</p><p></p><p>Rain - Because once it rains, you will probably get an umbrella and use it. So when you use the umbrella. The shaddow of the umbrella was describing to the Martian, about "property of making colours darker." Because the surface will became darker because of the shadow of the umbrella. Because their is a rain occur. So we use umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Automobile/Car - A Model T refers to an "automobile" because a car has a lock inside and it looks like a room, because their is a door and window and also seated chairs. And "a film" refers to a rearview mirror, because once the car is moving or starting forward. Once you see the rearview mirror, while driving. It looks like a film because it's moving backwards and anything missed.</p><p></p><p>Wristwatch- Because wristwatch is a time that it looks like tied by a wrist. And it also ticking.</p><p></p><p>Telephone - The martian said that " that snores when you pick up". Snore means "ringing" so once a tellephone rings, we will pick up. And we will carry it and directly to the lips. In order to talk to the caller on the telephone.</p><p></p><p>Bathroom/Toilet - Because punishment room refers to a "bathroom". And we also bring water. Suffer reffers to "pooping". And the pain refers to "pooping while your face is looks like crumpled", because when we pain also, our face looks liked crumpled. And different smell refers to "smells bad because of poop."</p><p></p><p>Sleeping People - Because it's night time. And also when our eyelids shut, we are like sleeping. And they "hide in pairs" refers to a 2 people/couple that was fully blanket when they sleep. </p><br />

                            27. What is the theme of peom "a martian sends a postcard home"? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>In “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home,” Raine underscores the notion that experience itself is insufficient for understanding the world, because we are all bound by personal and cultural ideas of what is. Another way of saying this is that experience is at once an interpretation and something to be interpreted.</p><p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>To express one’s impressions of humanity in terms that seem strange and puzzling at first and need a little working out before one realises what it is to which the poet is referring.</p><br />

                            28. how does the martian describe the forms of weather in the poem a martian sends a postcard home</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By describing natural elements such as rain and mist in terms of machines, the Martian suggests that his world is void of such elements but full of machines. This requires readers to attempt to envision a world without mist and rain, a task at least as difficult as the Martian's.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope i helped</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As the title indicates, this poem is written from the perspective of a Martian that visits Earth. In the poem, the Martian tries to explain the phenomena it sees on Earth, such as books, toilets, and rain, all discussed in a postcard home to its planet. However, due to the Martian's unfamiliarity with these concepts, they are presented in a strange way that makes them seem exotic and puzzling.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As the title indicates, this poem is written from the perspective of a Martian that visits Earth.
