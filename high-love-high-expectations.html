                                            Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees.

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

The first rule is to expect the best from the people youlead. A true leader needs to drop the role of "watchdog" and to display a positive attitude toward everyone who worksunder him or her. The second principle is to make a thorough study of the other person's needs. 2.( walk) amile in another person's shoes will allow a leader to truly understand someone he or she is working with. The third ruleis to establish high standards of excellence. Many people have never learned the pleasure of 3.(set) highstandards and 4.(live ) up to them. The fourth rule is to create an environment where failure is not fatal.People who expect to succeed all the time often cannot rise from a failure. An effective motivator needs to know how tohelp people deal with their failure.(Climb) on other people's bandwagons is the fifth principle that McGinnis suggests. A good leaderneeds to identify the beliefs and causes of the people that he/she works with. By 6.(use ) these good ideas,he/she can encourage them to pursue as many of these goals as possible. 7.(employ) models to encouragesuccess is the sixth rule. Everyone loves 8.(hear ) about true success stories of others to build confidenceand motivation. 9.(Recognize ) and 10.( applaud) achievement is the seventh rule. A goodleader tries to look for strengths in people and catch them doing something right so that he/she can compliment them.The eighth rule is to employ a mixture of positive and negative reinforcement. 11.(Express) praise is onlyone of many methods to motivate. Sometimes a person does his/her best because he/she is afraid to be punished. The( appeal ) sparingly to the competitive urge and 13.ninth and tenth rules relate to 12.(place) apremium on collaboration.

                            9. Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

Even sinners do that much! And if you lend money only those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return a Love your enemies! Do well to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate."​</h2><br />
