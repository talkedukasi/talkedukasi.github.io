                                            Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</a>

(STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society.
