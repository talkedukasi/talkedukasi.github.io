Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Romanticism (also known as the Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850.</p><p>2. True </p><p>3. When he was four years old, William Blake had a vision of "the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty!"

How did music change during the Romantic period?</p><p>Tone color became richer; harmony became more intricate. Dynamics, pitch, and tempo had wider ranges, and the use of rubato became popular.

Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />
