Below are the advantages of a square system, which of the following is not included? a. Better supervision of the orchard is possible. b. Certain amount of space in the middle of four trees is wasted c. Irrigation channels and paths can be made straight. d. Operations like plowing, harrowing, cultivating and harvesting becomes easy. 3.

Quincunx system c. Rectangular system d. Square system 4. It is desirable to have the trees planted in a systematic way due to the following reasons: I. Orchard operations like intercultural and irrigation are carried out easily. II. It makes possible the distribution of areas equally for each tree. III. It makes supervision easier and more effective. IV. It is well-arranged and nice to look at a. I &amp; II b. II, III &amp; IV c. III &amp; IV d. I, II &amp; III 5. It is an imaginary line connecting all points of equal elevation across a slope. a. Contour system b. Hexagonal system c. Quincunx system d. Square system 6. The following are few common steps in the layout procedure for different system except one. a. Measure the land b. Prepare a plan on the paper marking details c. Decide the types of trees to be planted d. Conduct a survey 7. Basically, this system is the same as the square system except for the addition of a tree in the middle of each square. The number of trees planted in the same area is almost double. a. Hexagonal system b. Quincunx system c. Rectangular system d. Square system 8. Which of the following is the disadvantage of contour system? a. Laying out of contour line is difficult and time consuming. b. Contour system can control the soil erosion c. It helps simultaneously in the conservation of water. d. It can be adopted in hilly regions and in leveled land. 9. A system where the trees are planted at the corners of an equilateral triangle. a.
