                            8. 7. A Tropical cyclone weakens and dies out when it hits masses of land. Why does it soA. Because the temperature of the land is low favorable to sustain the strength of the tropicalcycloneB. Because the cyclone is cut-off from the warm ocean water that keep them going.C. Cyclone needs landmasses in order to sustain its strengthD. Cyclone needs air mass from land to keep it going.8. How do landforms affect typhoonA. Landform like a mountain can help in formation of a cyclone because of its temperature.B. When a typhoon passes overland mass, it may lessen water vapor, weakened and died outbecause they are cut off from the ocean water.C. Land mass can produce hot and cold air moss that is essential in the development of acycloneD. The hot air mass from the sea can be replaced by hot air mass from the land to keep thecyclone going.9. What is the reason why most tropical cyclones move in a northwest directionsA. Because there are large-scale winds that push the tropical cyclone in that direction.B. Because there is a high pressure that affects the tropical cyclone to move in that directionC. Because there are so many tandforms in that direction that attract the typhoon.D.
