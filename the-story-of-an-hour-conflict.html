Write your answer in the boxes.THE STORY OF AN HOURBy Kate ChoppinLouise Mallard has a heart trouble, so she must be informed carefully about her husband’s death. Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise’s husband’s friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise’s husband. Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently’s death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he’s selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but can’t. She begins repeating the word Free! To herself over and over again. Her hearts beats quickly, and she feels very warm.Louise knows she’ll cry again when she sees Brently’s corpse. His hands were tender and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arm out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free, on her own without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic when her newfound sense of independence.Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she’ll get sick if she doesn’t. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richard is waiting.The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He had not been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of heart attack brought on by happiness.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE PLOT2.

So they caught it and wrung its neck. But they waren't prepared for the consequences. For what happened was that their mistress, not hearing the chicken crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night characters (major and minor characters give them names, description, traits, and feelings)setting (when and where be descriptive) ((says the book-))problem/conflict (the main dilemma that leads the characters to act the way they did)plot (major sequence of events in order . . . the action)begging       middle      ending​</a>

Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise’s husband’s friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise’s husband. Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently’s death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he’s selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but can’t. She begins repeating the word Free! To herself over and over again. Her hearts beats quickly, and she feels very warm.Louise knows she’ll cry again when she sees Brently’s corpse. His hands were tender and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arm out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free, on her own without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic when her newfound sense of independence.Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she’ll get sick if she doesn’t. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richard is waiting.The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He had not been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of heart attack brought on by happiness.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE PLOT2.
