                                            A PIECE THAT DOES ITS HOMEWORK There are some conspiracy theorists that claim that NASA's moon landing missions in the late 60's and 70's never happened, despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary. They claim the photographs were faked, the mission recordings were scripted, and the moon rocks were nothing more than ordinary earth rocks. Perhaps you are among these conspiracists. If so, let me prove to you that the moon landings took place. Perhaps you are skeptical of the US government, which was in the middle of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and a shooting war in Vietnam. Perhaps you believe that any information from NASA is therefore suspicious. Fortunately for you, there are plenty of third-party evidence that Americans traveled to and landed on the moon. An observatory in the UK that previously observed the Russian launch of the Sputnik probe used its radio telescope to observe the 1969 moon landing. The Bochum Observatory, this one in Germany, also confirms that mission. Finally, present-day photos from many different space agencies around the world have confirmed the presence of footprints, rover tracks, and the lunar rover themselves. In order for a moon landing to have been faked, the rocket scientist James Michael Longuski estimates that more than 400,000 people who worked on the projects in some capacity would have to keep the conspiracy a secret. In his 2006 book, The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist, Longuski suggests that, given how complicated it would be to fake such a project, it might be actually be easier to just go ahead and do the moon landing in the first place. 1. What is the author trying to say? 2. What are the claims of the conspiracy theorists about NASA's moon landing missions in the late 60's and 70' s? 3. What are the evidences that proved that moon landing is true? 4. What are the author's sources to support the claims? 5. How do we know that the author's sources are real (as proof of evidences)? Reflection: Answer the question with sound reasoning. Should those qualified get COVID-19 vaccination? Be sure to provide supporting statements.​</a>

                            5. A PIECE THAT DOES ITS HOMEWORK There are some conspiracy theorists that claim that NASA's moon landing missions in the late 60's and 70's never happened, despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary. They claim the photographs were faked, the mission recordings were scripted, and the moon rocks were nothing more than ordinary earth rocks. Perhaps you are among these conspiracists. If so, let me prove to you that the moon landings took place. Perhaps you are skeptical of the US government, which was in the middle of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and a shooting war in Vietnam. Perhaps you believe that any information from NASA is therefore suspicious. Fortunately for you, there are plenty of third-party evidence that Americans traveled to and landed on the moon. An observatory in the UK that previously observed the Russian launch of the Sputnik probe used its radio telescope to observe the 1969 moon landing. The Bochum Observatory, this one in Germany, also confirms that mission. Finally, present-day photos from many different space agencies around the world have confirmed the presence of footprints, rover tracks, and the lunar rover themselves. In order for a moon landing to have been faked, the rocket scientist James Michael Longuski estimates that more than 400,000 people who worked on the projects in some capacity would have to keep the conspiracy a secret. In his 2006 book, The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist, Longuski suggests that, given how complicated it would be to fake such a project, it might be actually be easier to just go ahead and do the moon landing in the first place. 1. What is the author trying to say? 2. What are the claims of the conspiracy theorists about NASA's moon landing missions in the late 60's and 70' s? 3. What are the evidences that proved that moon landing is true? 4. What are the author's sources to support the claims? 5. How do we know that the author's sources are real (as proof of evidences)? Reflection: Answer the question with sound reasoning. Should those qualified get COVID-19 vaccination? Be sure to provide supporting statements.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The author is trying to prove to the conspiracy theorists that NASA's moon landing missions did happen and provide evidence to support this claim.</p><p></p><p>2. The conspiracy theorists claim that the photographs were faked, the mission recordings were scripted, and the moon rocks were nothing more than ordinary earth rocks.</p><p></p><p>3. The evidences that proved that moon landing is true are third-party evidence from observatories in the UK and Germany, as well as present-day photos from different space agencies around the world that confirm the presence of footprints, rover tracks, and the lunar rover themselves.</p><p></p><p>4. The author's sources to support the claims are the observatories in the UK and Germany, as well as present-day photos from different space agencies around the world.</p><p></p><p>5. We can know that the author's sources are real (as proof of evidences) because they are third-party sources that are independent of NASA and the US government, providing an objective view of the events.</p><p></p><p>Reflection: Yes, those qualified should get COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect against COVID-19 and reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are qualified include the elderly, healthcare workers, and those with underlying health conditions. Getting vaccinated not only protects the individual but also helps to protect the community by reducing the spread of the virus. While vaccination is not a 100% guarantee of protection, it significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The author is trying to prove to the conspiracy theorists that the moon landing missions did take place and are not a hoax.</p><p>The conspiracy theorists claim that the moon landing missions never happened and the evidence presented by NASA is fake.</p><p>The third-party evidence that confirms the moon landing missions are the observatories in the UK and Germany that observed the mission, as well as present-day photos from various space agencies that show the footprints, rover tracks, and the lunar rover.</p><p>The author's sources are the UK and Germany observatories and various space agencies around the world.</p><p>We can know that the author's sources are real by researching and verifying the credibility of the observatories and space agencies cited.</p><p>Reflection: Yes, those qualified should get COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves and others from the virus. According to health experts, getting vaccinated is a crucial step in reducing the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The COVID-19 vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been proven safe and effective in protecting against the virus. Vaccination is not only a personal choice but a social responsibility to protect public health and reduce the risk of outbreaks.</p><p></p><br />
