Write your answers on the provided answer sheet found at the end of the learning activity sheets 1. Sectional view is purposely drawn to show the inside portion of the object. 2. Cutting Plane line is a fine line used to show the part of the object being cut. 3. Section Line is an imaginary line along which shows where an object is imagined cut to obtain a sectional view. 4. Section lines indicate the solid areas of a part. 5. Section line indicates the material from which a part is made. 6. Half Section is a type of sectional view that shows the entire cut surface of the view. 7. Full Section is a resulting view when the cutting plane is imagined at half-way across the object. 8. Broken-out Section is a type of view when there is portion of the view being taken out. 9. Revolved Section is a type of section applied to a circular object. The resulting view is similar to full section view. 10. Removed Section is generally used in furniture, machine, and architectural drawing. The appearance of the sectional view depends on the location of the cutting - plane lines. 11. Offset Section shows the zigzag direction of the cutting plane if the principal interior features of an object are not located in a straight line, it is necessary to offset the cutting - plane line to allow to pass through as many of the principal features of the object. 12.Assembly Section is a made up of a combination of the parts of all other section drawings. This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. 13.Sectioning shows more detailed illustration particularly on the internal parts of the object. 14.Section lines is an inclined line that forms 45 degrees angle. Each line must have at least 2mm distance from each other. 15.The direction of the cutting plane line is a major reference to consider in determining the form of view to be drawn. -​</h2><br />
