                                            The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears By:Robert Southey Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl. "This porridge is too hot)" she exclaimed. So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl. "This porridge is too cold," she said. So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge. "Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up. After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest. "This chair is too bigl" she exclaimed. So she sat in the second chair. "This chair is too big, tool" she whined. So she tried the last and smallest chair. "Ahhh, this chair is just right," she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces! Goldilocks and the Three Bears: sleeping-goldilocks .Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep. As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge," growled the Papa bear. " "Someone's been eating my porridge," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the Papa bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pleces," cried the Baby bear They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed." "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too" said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" exclaimed the Baby bear. Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, "Help!" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stalrs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears. THE END CHARACTERS : SETTINGS: RISING ACTION: CLIMAX : RESOLUTION:​ ​</a>

Goldilocks and the Three Bears "Once upon a time, there was a girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house." 侵 First, she eats three bowls of porridge sitting on the table. Then, she tests out three different chairs to see which one was most comfortable. After that escapade, she goes upstairs to lie down in each of the three beds. Sure enough, three bears come home and express horror over the fact that someone's been eating their porridge and sitting in their chairs. When they make their way upstairs and find her lying in Baby Bear's bed, Goldilocks screams, "Help!" and runs out of the room, never to return again. 11. She tests out three different chairs 12. She goes upstairs to lie down in each of the three beds 13. Goldilocks went for a walk in the forest 14. She eats the three bowls of porridge sitting on the table 15. Three bears come and find Goldilocks lying in Baby Bear's bed, she runs out of the room and never return again​</a>

                            4. The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears By:Robert Southey Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl. "This porridge is too hot)" she exclaimed. So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl. "This porridge is too cold," she said. So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge. "Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up. After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest. "This chair is too bigl" she exclaimed. So she sat in the second chair. "This chair is too big, tool" she whined. So she tried the last and smallest chair. "Ahhh, this chair is just right," she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces! Goldilocks and the Three Bears: sleeping-goldilocks .Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep. As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge," growled the Papa bear. " "Someone's been eating my porridge," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the Papa bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pleces," cried the Baby bear They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed." "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too" said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" exclaimed the Baby bear. Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, "Help!" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stalrs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears. THE END CHARACTERS : SETTINGS: RISING ACTION: CLIMAX : RESOLUTION:​ ​</h2><br />

                        <p>A family of three bears once lived in a small cottage in the middle of a forest: Baby Bear, Papa Bear, and the Bears' Mama. Mama Bear made a pot of porridge for breakfast one sunny day. The bears decided to take a walk while the porridge cooled because it was too hot to eat.</p><p></p><p>Goldilocks, a curious young girl, stumbled upon their cottage while they were out. She walked right in after knocking, but no one answered. She decided to try the porridge when she saw the pot on the table inside. She exclaimed, "This porridge is too hot!" after tasting the first bowl. She exclaimed, "This porridge is too cold!" after tasting the second bowl. After giving the third bowl a try, she declared, "Ah, this porridge is just right."</p><p></p><p>Goldilocks looked for a place to rest after her long walk because she was exhausted. The living room contained three chairs for her: three chairs: one large, one medium, and one small. She attempted the principal seat and shouted, "This seat is too enormous!" She gave the second chair a try, but she sighed and said, "This chair is too small." Then she sat on the third seat and said, "Ah, this seat is perfect."</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, Goldilocks became drowsy and chosen to track down a spot to rest. She went up and discovered three beds: three beds: a large, a medium, and a small one. She put the first bed to the test and complained, "This bed is too hard!" She put the second bed to the test and complained, "This bed is too soft!" After that, she fell asleep on the third bed and exclaimed, "Ah, this bed is just right."</p><p></p><p>But Goldilocks had no idea that she had broken into the bears' house. They knew someone had been there when they returned from their walk to find their cottage in disarray. They were taken aback when they discovered Goldilocks asleep in Baby Bear's bed and woke her up. She rushed out of the cottage and back into the forest, terrified, and never came back.</p><p></p><p>The lesson here: Before entering someone else's home, always ask for permission.</p><br />
