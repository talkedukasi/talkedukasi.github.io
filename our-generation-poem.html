Pre-Colonial Philippine Literature
Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, early Filipinos had
civilization of their own. It partly came from the Malay settlers and partly from
their response to the new environment. The variety and abundance of their
customs and traditions have become evident even in the Philippine Pre-
Colonial Literature. Folk stories, epics, poems and chants existed in the most
Ethno-linguistic groups that were passed on from generation to generation
through word of mouth. This happened as people moved from one environment
to another.
1. How did our rich literature that was developed and cultivated by our ancestors survive until now?
2. What was evident in the Philippine Pre-Colonial Literature?</a>

Now we assert,How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?We will not be turned around or interrupted byintimidation,because we know our inaction and inertia will bethe inheritance of the next generation.​</a>

                                            The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify the lessons of life; they disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction. But the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters.1.

Plant a Better Tomorrow by Maricon Estrellado Total To help you in appreciating the poem, here is a list to unlock difficulties: beheld look desolation - sadness reminisce recall toto all together bountiful generous As I beheld up the sky, something waved "hi," With its hands desperately reaching up the sky. They danced with the wind, going side to side, Swayed their arms and shoulders in toto, Trying its best to be noticed and be spoken to. In which it succeeded; I saw it standing alone in the midst of hopelessness and desolation. It led me to reminisce how the scene was like before, When the leafy hands were momentously bountiful, The strong twigs swayed more and were indeed blissful. If yesterday, there were more and today, there is one, How about our tomorrow? Would that one stand still or would there be none? Or, it would be better if we'll plant near that one. 11 Real Image Make-Believe Image PIVOT 4A CALABARZON​</a>

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

Pre-Colonial Philippine Literature
Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, early Filipinos had
civilization of their own. It partly came from the Malay settlers and partly from
their response to the new environment. The variety and abundance of their
customs and traditions have become evident even in the Philippine Pre-
Colonial Literature. Folk stories, epics, poems and chants existed in the most
Ethno-linguistic groups that were passed on from generation to generation
through word of mouth. This happened as people moved from one environment
to another.

                            8. The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify the lessons of life; they disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction. But the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters.1.

Plant a Better Tomorrow by Maricon Estrellado Total To help you in appreciating the poem, here is a list to unlock difficulties: beheld look desolation - sadness reminisce recall toto all together bountiful generous As I beheld up the sky, something waved "hi," With its hands desperately reaching up the sky. They danced with the wind, going side to side, Swayed their arms and shoulders in toto, Trying its best to be noticed and be spoken to. In which it succeeded; I saw it standing alone in the midst of hopelessness and desolation. It led me to reminisce how the scene was like before, When the leafy hands were momentously bountiful, The strong twigs swayed more and were indeed blissful. If yesterday, there were more and today, there is one, How about our tomorrow? Would that one stand still or would there be none? Or, it would be better if we'll plant near that one. 11 Real Image Make-Believe Image PIVOT 4A CALABARZON​</h2><br />

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable

With long-patience and all lovable.

To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.

Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.

Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.
