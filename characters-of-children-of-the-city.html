                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions : (Citing Text Evidence)1. Title of the Text :2.

                                            Learning Task 1Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Identify what type of paragraph it is by writing Narrative, Descriptive, Expository, Persuasive or Literary. (10 points)___________ 1. My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool.  We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.  He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!”___________ 2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse.___________ 3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.___________ 4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating.___________ 5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.​</a>

                                            I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

Edukasyon para sa lahat. Isa ito sa mga isinusulong ng
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Kung kaya’t
ang Kagawaran ng Edukasyon ay nagkaroon ng iba’t ibang
programa upang ipatupad ito. Ilan na nga sa mga ito ay ang
Alternative Learning System (ALS) para sa mga out-of-school
youths, kariton klasrum at oplan-balik eskwela. Mayroon ding
programa para sa mga batang differently abled—ang Special
Education.

Taong 2009 nang tugunan ng kagawaran ang problema sa
Special Education kung saan, sa target na 2.2 milyong batang
may disabilities ay 2% lamang ang nakakapag-aral. Ipinatupad
ang DepEd Order 72, s. 2009 o ang Inclusive Education as
Strategy for Increasing Participation Rate of Children. Layunin
nito na tanggapin ang mga mag-aaral anoman ang kanilang
pinagmulan, laki, hugis, abilidad o disability kasama ang
suporta ng paaralan, mag-aaral, magulang at komunidad. Nararapat lamang na tugunan ng bawat paaralan ang
panawagan na itong Kagawaran ng Edukasyon. Ang bawat bata ay may karapatan. Isa na nga rito ay ang
karapatang mag-aral. Isa ang San Roque Elementary School sa
mga paaralan sa Pilipinas na mayroong Special Education
program. Mayroon ding mainstreaming kung saan inihahalo ang
mga SpEd pupils sa regular class hanggang sila ay
makapagtapos sa elementarya. Gayundin ang mga batang Gifted
at Talented pati na rin ang mga pipi at bingi. Iba man sa paningin ngunit sila ay may karapatan din. Ituring natin silang katulad natin at bigyan natin sila ng pantay
na pagtingin.

                                            Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

(5 pts each) A person who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of an enterprise is called entrepreneur. The entrepreneur starts a business, willing to take risks in order to make money, and they are the ones involved in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship started as early as 17,000 B.C.E where the first known instance as humans trading comes from New Guinea when locals exchange obsidian used to make hunting arrowheads for other needed goods. The original entrepreneurs were traders and merchants until the development of the market system and the invention of money. In modern city, entrepreneurship continues to become a major factor affecting our economy since every organization had an entrepreneurial beginning of organization. As modern society continues to develop, the range of entrepreneurship also increased as I was already possible to have young entrepreneurs. Furthermore, students are already studying entrepreneurship that can help them determine the importance and benefits of being involved in business. The essay aims to evaluate the importance of being into business even at such as young age and its benefits to graduating students (Chico, 2014). ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ Batman. Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us. This essay will discuss the history of superheroes, the difference between superheroes and other fictional characters, and how all these things have positively affected society (Suarez, 2012). ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive​​​</a>

Every day, the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest. He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples, and they would play hide-and-go- seek. When he was tired, he would sleep in her shade, and the boy loved the tree.. very much, and the tree was happy. But time went by, and the boy grew older, and the tree was often alone. One day, the boy came to the tree and the tree said," Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches. "Eat my apples and play in my shade and be happy." "I am too big to climb and play," said the boy. "I want to buy things and have fun. I want some money. Can you give me some money?" "I am sorry," said the tree, "but I have no money. I have only leaves and apples. Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city, then you will have money and you will be happy." And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away. And the tree was happy. But the boy stayed away for a long time... and the tree was sad. And then one day, the boy came back and the tree shook with joy. And she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy." "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy. "I want a house to keep me warm," he said. I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house. Can you give me a house?" 1 have no house," said the tree. "The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy." And so the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house.

                                            8 A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

Sabi namin i-tighten, ang conditions arevery, very stringent," Briones said in an online Palace briefing.(We are preparing in case the President lifts the deferment of the pilot studies.We tightened it, the conditions are very, very stringent.)Briones said the pilot study of face-to-face classes must be approved by localgovernment units before it is implemented.There must also be a written consent from parents allowing their children topartake in the pilot study of face-to-face classes, Briones added."May mga parents na hindi pa rin nila lubos ma-gets o makita kung ano angpuwedeng advantage kung magkaroon tayo ng face-to-face," Brionesexplained.(There are parents who still do not understand the advantages of having faceto-face classes.)"So kailangan na consent ng parents dahil kung minsan nakikita natin nakung may mangyayari baka sisihin ang DepEd o kung sino ang sisisihin, sokailangang papayag ang parents," she went on.(So there must be parents' consent because if something happens, they mightblame DepEd or whoever, so parents must give their consent.)Briones also noted only schools that are physically near hospitals, havemedicines and water access may be allowed to join the face-to-face classes dryrun.

As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.

The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.

                            3. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions : (Citing Text Evidence)1. Title of the Text :2.

Author / Source: UNICEF report "The State of the World's Children 2012: Children in an Urban World"</p><p>3. According to the Text: The text discusses the issue of urbanization in developing countries and how it leaves millions of children excluded from vital services. In the Philippines, half the population lives in cities, with 1.7 million children living in informal settlements in Metro Manila alone. Children in poor urban communities lack access to decent housing, and clean water, and are more prone to neglect, abuse, and exploitation. The deprivations endured by these children are often obscured by broad statistical averages that overlook the needs of the poorest.</p><p>4. Based on what I read: Urbanization in developing countries leaves millions of children excluded from vital services, including clean water, decent housing, and protection from neglect and abuse. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services.</p><p>5. I know that many children in poor urban communities suffer from multiple deprivations that hinder their development and well-being. This is because the text states that children lack access to basic needs such as clean water, decent housing, and protection from neglect and abuse.</p><p>6. I believe the character acted this way because of the social and economic circumstances they were born into. Children living in poor urban communities are often exposed to dangers from disasters and lack access to basic services due to poverty and inadequate infrastructure.</p><p>7. I feel concerned about the plight of children living in poor urban communities because according to the text, they experience multiple deprivations and are more prone to neglect, abuse, and exploitation. The text highlights the importance of addressing the needs of the poorest in urban policy and allocating resources to ensure that all children have access to basic services and opportunities for development.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The sand was soft and cool.  We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.  He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!”___________ 2.

His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse.___________ 3.

Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.___________ 4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating.___________ 5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.​</h2><br />

                            9. I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

may disabilities ay 2% lamang ang nakakapag-aral. Ipinatupad
ang DepEd Order 72, s. 2009 o ang Inclusive Education as
Strategy for Increasing Participation Rate of Children. Layunin
nito na tanggapin ang mga mag-aaral anoman ang kanilang
pinagmulan, laki, hugis, abilidad o disability kasama ang
suporta ng paaralan, mag-aaral, magulang at komunidad. Nararapat lamang na tugunan ng bawat paaralan ang
panawagan na itong Kagawaran ng Edukasyon. Ang bawat bata ay may karapatan. Isa na nga rito ay ang
karapatang mag-aral. Isa ang San Roque Elementary School sa
mga paaralan sa Pilipinas na mayroong Special Education
program. Mayroon ding mainstreaming kung saan inihahalo ang
mga SpEd pupils sa regular class hanggang sila ay
makapagtapos sa elementarya. Gayundin ang mga batang Gifted

                            12. Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1. The characters in the novel are:Park So-nyo: the mother who goes missing in the cityPark So-nyo's husband: a retired civil servant who is often distant from his familyPark So-nyo's eldest daughter: a successful writer who feels guilty for not being there for her motherPark So-nyo's eldest son: a university professor who has a strained relationship with his motherPark So-nyo's youngest daughter: a freelance editor who is pregnant and worried about her mother's disappearanceChi-hon: the youngest son who is assigned to prepare the flyer's caption<p></p><p>2.Park So-nyo is lost in the city because she got separated from her husband at the train station and was unable to find her way back home.</p><p></p><p>3. The novel explores the complex relationships between Park So-nyo and her children and husband. There are tensions and resentments among them due to their different personalities, lifestyles, and expectations. For example, Park So-nyo's eldest daughter feels guilty for not being there for her mother, while her eldest son has a strained relationship with her due to her lack of education. Her husband is often distant from his family, and her youngest daughter is worried about her pregnancy and future.</p><p></p><p>4. Chi-hon is assigned to prepare the flyer's caption as a punishment for his irresponsible behavior at work. This comes in contrast to his line of work as a successful novelist.</p><p></p><p>5. Park So-nyo is portrayed as a devoted mother who sacrifices her own needs for her family. She is described as someone who always puts her children first, even if it means neglecting her own health and well-being. For example, she skips meals and works long hours to provide for her family. She is also very supportive of her children's dreams and aspirations.</p><p></p><p>6. Park So-nyo's family feels a deep sense of pain and regret towards her because they realize how much they took her for granted. They feel guilty for not appreciating her enough when she was around and for not paying attention to her needs and struggles.</p><p></p><p>7. It is possible that Park So-nyo's husband and children could have helped her if they had paid more attention to her and her illness. However, it is also important to note that Park So-nyo herself did not share her struggles and pain with her family, so they were not aware of the extent of her suffering.</p><p></p><p>8. The loss of their mom brings both positive and negative things to the family. On the one hand, they realize the importance of family and become closer to each other. On the other hand, they are consumed by guilt and regret for not treating their mom better when she was alive.</p><p></p><p>9. The novel is particularly Korean in its portrayal of the Confucian values of filial piety and respect for elders. It also includes references to Korean food, language, and traditions. However, the story's themes of family, love, and loss are universal and relatable to readers from different cultures and backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The main characters in the novel are:</p>Park So-nyo: a hardworking and selfless mother who goes missing in the cityPark So-nyo's husband: a retired civil servant who is often distant from his familyPark So-nyo's eldest daughter: a successful writer who feels guilty about her neglect of her motherPark So-nyo's eldest son: a struggling writer who resents his mother's lack of support for his careerPark So-nyo's younger daughter: a stay-at-home mom who tries to fill the void left by her mother's absenceChi-hon: a transgender woman who works at a cosmetics counter and becomes involved in the search for Park So-nyo<p></p><p>2.Park So-nyo is lost in the city because she gets separated from her husband while they are traveling by train to visit their children in Seoul.</p><p></p><p>3. We learn that Park So-nyo has sacrificed a lot for her family and that she is deeply loved by her children, despite some tension and resentment. Her husband is often distant and critical of her, which causes her pain and frustration. Her eldest son feels neglected by her and resents her lack of support for his writing career. Her eldest daughter feels guilty about neglecting her mother and not appreciating her sacrifices, while her younger daughter tries to take on her mother's role in the family.</p><p></p><p>4. Chi-hon is assigned to prepare the flyer's caption because she is a writer and has a way with words. This comes in contrast to her line of work as a cosmetics salesperson, which is not as fulfilling for her.</p><p></p><p>5. Park So-nyo is portrayed as a loving and selfless mother who always puts her family's needs before her own. She works hard to provide for them and is always there to offer support and encouragement. For example, she stays up late to help her son with his writing, even though she is exhausted from her own work. She also sacrifices her own health for the sake of her family, which ultimately leads to her disappearance.</p><p></p><p>6. Park So-nyo's family feels a lot of pain and regret towards her because they realize how much she has sacrificed for them and how much they have taken her for granted. They feel guilty for not appreciating her more and for not taking better care of her when she was struggling with her health.</p><p></p><p>7. It is possible that Park So-nyo's husband and children could have helped her if they had paid more attention to her and her illness. However, it is also important to note that she never complained or asked for help, and that her family was often too preoccupied with their own problems to notice her struggles.</p><p></p><p>8. The loss of their mom brings positive things to the family in the sense that it forces them to confront their own shortcomings and to appreciate each other more. They also come to realize how important their mother was to their lives and how much they have taken her for granted.</p><p></p><p>9. The story is particularly Korean in its portrayal of the traditional roles of mothers in Korean society and the importance of family ties. It also touches on themes of Confucianism and the Korean War. However, the universal themes of love, loss, and family relationships make the story relatable to readers from all cultures.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Entrepreneurship started as early as 17,000 B.C.E where the first known instance as humans trading comes from New Guinea when locals exchange obsidian used to make hunting arrowheads for other needed goods. The original entrepreneurs were traders and merchants until the development of the market system and the invention of money. In modern city, entrepreneurship continues to become a major factor affecting our economy since every organization had an entrepreneurial beginning of organization.

Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us.

                            17. 1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive​​​</h2><br />

                            21. The Giving TreebyShel SilversteinOncethere was a tree...and she loved a little boy. Every day, the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest. He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples, and they would play hide-and-go- seek. When he was tired, he would sleep in her shade, and the boy loved the tree.. very much, and the tree was happy. But time went by, and the boy grew older, and the tree was often alone. One day, the boy came to the tree and the tree said," Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches. "Eat my apples and play in my shade and be happy." "I am too big to climb and play," said the boy. "I want to buy things and have fun. I want some money. Can you give me some money?" "I am sorry," said the tree, "but I have no money. I have only leaves and apples. Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city, then you will have money and you will be happy." And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away. And the tree was happy. But the boy stayed away for a long time... and the tree was sad. And then one day, the boy came back and the tree shook with joy. And she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy." "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy. "I want a house to keep me warm," he said. I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house. Can you give me a house?" 1 have no house," said the tree. "The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy." And so the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house.

                            23. 8 A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

                            26. 1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.

The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.
