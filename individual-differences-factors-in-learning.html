Mendel also studied the inheritance of two pairs of factors in anindividual. Ais used to show how allelic pair of genes for aspecific trait separates and recombines independently. It is a cross betweentwo individuals that are both heterozygous for two different traits.2. The purpose of Dibybrid cross is to determine if any of the relationshipexisted between different allelic pairs.

It is a cross betweentwo individuals that are both heterozygous for two different traits.2. The purpose of Dihybrid cross is to determine if any of the relationshopezisted between different allelic pairs.

The idea that for any particular trait, the pair of alleles of each parentseparate and only one allele from each parent passes to an offspring isMendel's principle of10.

In Metacognitive Teaching, learners are trained to become aware of and exert control over their own learning vy using metacognitive processes . 3. In Inquiry Teaching learners are confronted with a puzzling situation and are led to enter into investigative work to solve the problem . 4. In Expository Strategies or Direct Instruction, the Desired Outcomes are development and formulation of concept , principles, attitudes and values. 5. In Exploratory Strategies or Guided Instruction, the Learning Environments are similar . 6. The three fundamental laws of learning by the Association Theory are the law of readiness, law of exercise and law of effect. 7. The law of exercise is where learning is strenthened if it results in satisfaction, but is weakened if it leads to vexation or annoyance. 8. Stimulus Response (SR) or Association Theory of learning states that in every stimulus there is a corresponding response 9. The factors affecting individual differences are age differences and personal adjustments , sex differences, family and community background , physical conditions , emotional response and attitudes ( EQ), and mental abilities and specific aptitudes (IQ) . 10.

Mendel also studied the inheritance of two pairs of factors in anindividual. Ais used to show how allelic pair of genes for aspecific trait separates and recombines independently. It is a cross betweentwo individuals that are both heterozygous for two different traits.2. The purpose of Dibybrid cross is to determine if any of the relationshipexisted between different allelic pairs.

In Inquiry Teaching learners are confronted with a puzzling situation and are led to enter into investigative work to solve the problem . 4. In Expository Strategies or Direct Instruction, the Desired Outcomes are development and formulation of concept , principles, attitudes and values. 5. In Exploratory Strategies or Guided Instruction, the Learning Environments are similar . 6. The three fundamental laws of learning by the Association Theory are the law of readiness, law of exercise and law of effect. 7. The law of exercise is where learning is strenthened if it results in satisfaction, but is weakened if it leads to vexation or annoyance. 8. Stimulus Response (SR) or Association Theory of learning states that in every stimulus there is a corresponding response 9. The factors affecting individual differences are age differences and personal adjustments , sex differences, family and community background , physical conditions , emotional response and attitudes ( EQ), and mental abilities and specific aptitudes (IQ) . 10.
