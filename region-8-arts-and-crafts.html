Tinalik baskets - CAR<p>From small woven jars to portable lunchboxes, baskets come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Cordillera Central refers to the island of Luzon in the Philippines' northernmost mountains. For many years, basketry was a vital component of every aspect of daily life in this region. Many traditional basket shapes are still in existence today solely because of foreigners' interest in Philippine handicrafts.</p>2. Pastillas wrapper - Bulacan<p>Pastillas are a class of milk-based sweets that were invented in the Philippine town of San Miguel, Bulacan Province. They are also known as pastillas de leche (lit., Milk Pills) or pastiyema. Making pastillas spread from San Miguel to other Philippine areas like Cagayan and Masbate. Refined sugar and calamansi juice are also included when creating pastillas.</p>3.

However, inabel is specifically used in the context of weaving to describe material that is clearly of Ilocano origin.</p>5. Tattoo Art - CAR<p>In the Philippines' Cordillera, tattoos are commonly referred to as "batok." In the sixteenth century, the Bontok, Ifugao, and Kalinga tribes also participated in the activity. Other Cordilleran languages have regional counterparts. But a tattoo artist may be both.</p>6. Singkaban Festival - Bulacan<p>The Singkaban Festival is a well-known celebration in the province of Bulacan.  "Bagong Bulakenyo: maka-Diyos, makatao at makakalikasan" is the theme of the festival.

The church, which was finished in 1710, is renowned for its distinctive architecture. It was recognized as a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine government in 1973 and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.</p>8. Banaue Rice Terraces - CAR<p>The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are a series of rice terraces on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. They were the first property to be listed in the World Heritage List's cultural landscape category. Intricate irrigation systems, water collection from mountaintop forests, and a sophisticated agricultural system are all part of the Ifugao complex of stone or mud walls.</p>9. Bakwat - Cagayan Valley<p>We are proud to contribute our many artistic creations to our country as proud Ilocanos, and we are proud of our traditions and cultures.  Bakwat Ilocanos: We are proud to contribute our many artistic creations to our country. Bakwat, which was popular in the province of Nueva Viscaya, Cagayan Valley, symbolizes the joy that every mother experiences after giving birth because it is a gift from their God.</p>10. Ikat weaving - CAR<p>Ikat, which in Indonesian means "to knot or to bind," has a Philippine variation that is renowned for its vibrant colors and eye-catching patterns. The Ifugao tribes and other ethnic groups in Mindanao mostly conduct Philippine ikat weaving in the Cordilleras of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>More information related to Philiphines arts you can get at the link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/889050</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1528161</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
