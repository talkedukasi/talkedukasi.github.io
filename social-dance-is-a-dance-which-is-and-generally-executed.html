                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Curl Down and Up</p><p>Starting in jazz first position (feet parallel facing front), with your arms at your side and your gaze focused downward, curl your spine over slowly, being careful not to collapse at the waist. When you are halfway down to the floor, bend your knees and continue to "curl." Your instructor may tell you to curl down one vertebrae at a time, and then subsequently "grow back upward," again with one section of your spine at a timeLeg Swings</p><p>Standing again in parallel first, place your arms in second position. Sliding the right leg forward with a pointed toe, it should then brush through the first position and follow through backwards, slightly bending the knee. This is often used as a transitional movement in a combination of choreographyFlat Back</p><p>It sounds simple enough, but a flat back executed properly takes a distinct amount of discipline and flexibility. After you have bent over, keeping your spine as straight as possible, raise your arms into high fifth with the palms facing inward. Raise the torso back up, simultaneously with the arms as a single fluid movement. This step is a wonderful exhibition of grace and bodily control, almost derived from its ancestor ballet.</p><p></p><p>No Boundaries</p><p>A common rule is that all modern dance steps are essentially the derivative of something else. Be it classical ballet or a tree outside your window on an exceptionally windy day, modern dancers find choreography sources in every single movement they witness in life, and the ability to do so is stunning.</p><p></p><p>If you are pursuing modern dance as either a career or hobby, do not be afraid to create dance steps out of thin air, as the results can be nothing short of amazing, and most definitely rewarding.Tendu</p><p>With tendus, the foot points forward and back into parallel first. You can then repeat the position to the side and to the back, alternating in a rhythm. This is commonly a floor exercise, but can also be used in routines.</p><p></p><p>Chasse</p><p>The chasse is a simple jump found often in modern dance. Standing with the weight on one foot, you shift the weight while in a plie stance, and then jump so both feet are vertical together in the air. You can travel across the room with this movement, and add height and a spin for a more advanced look.</p><p></p><br />
