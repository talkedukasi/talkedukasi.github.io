                            3. Why is it important to discuss means of birth control or contraception and sexually transmitted diseases as topics included under “The Sexual Self?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>There are several reasons why it is important to discuss means of birth control and contraception, as well as sexually transmitted diseases, as part of a conversation about "The Sexual Self."</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, discussing these topics can help to promote sexual health and well-being. Understanding different methods of birth control and contraception can help individuals make informed decisions about their sexual health, and can help prevent unintended pregnancies. Similarly, discussing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can help to raise awareness about the risks of unprotected sex and the importance of regular testing and treatment.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, discussing these topics can also help to reduce the stigma and shame that often surrounds discussions of sexuality. By having open and honest conversations about birth control, contraception, and STDs, individuals can feel more comfortable and empowered to take control of their own sexual health.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the societal and cultural expectations that are placed on the sexual self are different around the world, it can be difficult to understand the perspectives of others. Being able to discuss these topics openly, and in a safe and non-judgmental environment, can help to promote a better understanding of different perspectives and experiences related to sexuality.</p><p></p><p>Overall, discussing means of birth control, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases as part of a conversation about "The Sexual Self" can help to promote sexual health, reduce stigma, and increase understanding and empathy</p><br />

The best way to capture the interest of the audience is to take advantage of the right <strong>communicative strategy</strong> whenever we give a talk.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Seven Communicative Strategies:</strong></p><strong>Nomination Strategy</strong><strong><br /></strong>When someone is presenting a particular topic, or saying what he thinks is relevant, he is using the <strong>nomination strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Restriction</strong><strong><br /></strong>With the support of enough set of categories that are to be constrained by a particular response or reaction, someone is using a <strong>restriction strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Turn-taking</strong><strong><br /></strong>A person knows when to speak or respond because he knows when is the right time to speak or his turn. That uis when someone applies the <strong>turn-taking strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic control</strong><strong><br /></strong>Someone is using the <strong>topic control strategy</strong> by making sure that the interaction is ongoing. The use of topic control strategy requires techniques to keep the <strong>conversation going.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic shifting</strong><strong><br /></strong>The process of <strong>topic shifting</strong> is continuing a communication or interaction by asking relevant questions or elaborating what someone said.<br /><strong>Repair</strong><strong><br /></strong>When the communication is not in good shape, <strong>a repair strategy </strong>is being done to overcome communication breakdown.<br /><strong>Termination</strong><strong><br /></strong>It uses verbal or nonverbal signals to end communication or interaction.<br /><p>It is important for us to learn the different types of communicative strategies and properly use them in every situation.
