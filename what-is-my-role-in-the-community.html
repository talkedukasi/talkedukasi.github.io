                            24. 1. Discuss what is the difference between global and local community. 2. Cite at least 3 examples of community members who are present in your barangay (ex. Barangay tanod, barangay health workers, etc.), Explain their roles and functions. 3. Am I a responsible/productive members of my community? 4. What role am I playing in our community? 5. Am I making my community better?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1) The main difference between global and local communities is their scope and scale. A global community refers to a group of people connected by a common interest, goal or identity that transcends geographical boundaries. It includes people from different parts of the world who share a common goal or concern, such as human rights, climate change, or social justice. On the other hand, a local community refers to a group of people who share a common geographical location, such as a neighborhood, village, or town. The members of a local community interact more frequently and are more connected to each other through shared experiences and resources.</p><p></p><p>2) Examples of community members who are present in a barangay may include barangay tanod, barangay health workers, and barangay officials. Barangay tanod serves as the community's peace and order officers, while barangay health workers provide healthcare services and medical assistance to residents. Barangay officials, on the other hand, are elected officials who manage the barangay's affairs and ensure that government programs and services are delivered to the residents.</p><p></p><p>3) A guide to answer this question: To determine if you are a responsible/productive member of your community, you need to evaluate how you contribute to the community's growth and development. Ask yourself if you actively participate in community activities, follow rules and regulations, and support initiatives that benefit the community. Do you volunteer for community service projects, attend meetings and forums, and actively seek ways to improve your skills and knowledge? If yes, then you can consider yourself as a responsible and productive member of your community.</p><p></p><p>4) As an individual, your role in the community may vary depending on your skills, interests, and resources. Some examples of roles that you can play in the community include a volunteer, advocate, mentor, leader, and organizer. You can also contribute to the community by supporting local businesses, promoting cultural and artistic events, and being an active member of local groups and organizations.</p><p></p><p>5) Making your community better requires a collective effort from all members. You can contribute to the community's improvement by actively participating in community activities, supporting local businesses, volunteering for community service projects, and being a responsible citizen. By doing so, you can help build a stronger, more resilient, and more vibrant community that benefits everyone.</p><br />
