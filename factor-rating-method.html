                                            The continued growth of technology has had a significant impact on the politicalratings that candidates achieve. The article Impact of Technology on Politics attempts toanalyze how these two spheres of modern life, technology and politics, interrelate andwhat the outcomes are of this interrelationship. Political candidates use technology inmany ways. Different communication channels provided by the Internet have the powerto influence the growth of different individuals in their respective spheres. The likes ofTwitter, Facebook, and You Tube are powerful communication media platforms that caneasily raise the ratings of political candidates. Housley claims that whether weacknowledge it or not, technology is a deciding factor in most political races. Throughtechnology, politicians are able to access funds, gain political pundits, and spend less oncampaigning and pushing their candidacy. One of the ways in which technologyinfluences politics is the financial side. Raising funds to use for campaigning is animportant factor for political candidates. It comes with the need to create a verticalresponse to the whole country or target region. This is a major hurdle experienced bypolitical candidates. The Internet aided Howard Dean to get donations that he required togain access to a large part of the campaign region. By broadcasting through technologicalmarketing, candidates get suitable donors to support different parts of their campaignsPublicity on the Internet is a cheap method, as they do not have to re-publish, unlike whatis provided by the print media. This is placed in various commonly-accessed links(Housley, Par. 1). The Internet enables politicians to use podcasting. The act of podcastingcan make anyone a journalist. Through podcasting, politicians are able to portray ajournalistic stature, thereby ensuring that the information is considered credible. Self-proclamation of politicians through pundits is easily spread through messages. It is,however, difficult for politicians to guarantee the integrity of the information posted.​</a>

                            14. The continued growth of technology has had a significant impact on the politicalratings that candidates achieve. The article Impact of Technology on Politics attempts toanalyze how these two spheres of modern life, technology and politics, interrelate andwhat the outcomes are of this interrelationship. Political candidates use technology inmany ways. Different communication channels provided by the Internet have the powerto influence the growth of different individuals in their respective spheres. The likes ofTwitter, Facebook, and You Tube are powerful communication media platforms that caneasily raise the ratings of political candidates. Housley claims that whether weacknowledge it or not, technology is a deciding factor in most political races. Throughtechnology, politicians are able to access funds, gain political pundits, and spend less oncampaigning and pushing their candidacy. One of the ways in which technologyinfluences politics is the financial side. Raising funds to use for campaigning is animportant factor for political candidates. It comes with the need to create a verticalresponse to the whole country or target region. This is a major hurdle experienced bypolitical candidates. The Internet aided Howard Dean to get donations that he required togain access to a large part of the campaign region. By broadcasting through technologicalmarketing, candidates get suitable donors to support different parts of their campaignsPublicity on the Internet is a cheap method, as they do not have to re-publish, unlike whatis provided by the print media. This is placed in various commonly-accessed links(Housley, Par. 1). The Internet enables politicians to use podcasting. The act of podcastingcan make anyone a journalist. Through podcasting, politicians are able to portray ajournalistic stature, thereby ensuring that the information is considered credible. Self-proclamation of politicians through pundits is easily spread through messages. It is,however, difficult for politicians to guarantee the integrity of the information posted.​</h2><br />
