the core. The outer layer, called the crust, is
between 16 and 40
kilometers thick. It floats on a thicker layer known as the mantle, which is
2,895 kilometers thick.
The core, which is 3,475 kilometers thick, is
surrounded by the mantle.
The innermost part is solid (the inner core)
while the outer part is liquid (the outer core).
2. An old man suffering from a nagging back ache went to see his

his back. After a week, he came back still complaining about the pain. The
doctor asked him if he followed the directions. The man turned and on his
back was the prescription firmly posted.
3. At no time in history have humans produced so much waste. Ours
is a throw-away society. No matter which area is examined, it is found that
for health, safety, advertising, or other reasons, we produce more waste. We
must implement ways to make use of people's waste to prevent further
humanity</a>

He was shocked to see an old man taking a nap under the shade of a tree. If it were other people, the king would have been angry. Instead he asked his soldier to help the old man to find his way home. The man turned out to be a fairy. When she found out that king Midas was a good man. She gave him one wish. The king wished that everything he touched will turn into gold.                                                            King Midas wanted to test whether his magic wish was true. He was so happy when the flower he touched turned into gold. The king touched a statue. It also turned to gold!" he gladly said. He began to touch many other things which all turned into gold. Moments later the king finally got tired. He went inside his palace and asked for food. King Midas was frustrated when every food he touches turned into gold. His attention shifted to the door when he heard a tiny voice. "Father!" called princess Armida. King Midas mind suddenly went blank. He tried to avoid his daughter but she suddenly embrace him. King Midas did not know what to do. He later thought of finding the fairy in the palace's garden. The king begged for the fairy's mercy. He ashed her to take back the the powers she gave him. The fairy took pity of the king. The king shed tears of joy when everything turned back to normal. He realized it was not good to wished for so much wealth.                                                      1.

His ears are turned backwhile his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His facedisplays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and hisfiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensedand thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds ofa tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves thatcould crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up andhis hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressedinto the earth, therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. Hisblack tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floatsdown back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength arewhat made his breed prized as a warhorse. (Jamell Wilson, 2005)​</a>

Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal.

He died an extraordinary man of his times: renowned novelist, poet, ophthalmologist, journalist, and linguist. But behind these achievements, there remained the story of a man every Filipinocan relate and connect to. Like today's overseas Filipino, Rizal needed to leave his family to fulfill his studies and career abroad, suffering from homesickness, and enduring a long-distance relationship with the woman he loved most. He was also the best example of the Filipino who came back home and used the knowledge and skills he learned abroad to help improve the lives of his family and countrymen.1. Title of the movie2.

 The Wind and the Sun 
 The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man’s back the quickest. The wind began. He blew strong gust so fair, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. Then, the wind blew harder and longer. The harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was tired, but he could not remove the coat from the man’s back. It was now the sun’s turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shady tree.

Alex shut the lid to his laptop with a loud clap. Some of the people sitting at
the tables near him looked up from their books and gave him annoyed looks. Alex
realized that he had disturbed them and held up his hand apologetically. The
librarian turned toward him and

noise that he had made. Alex put the laptop in his bag and began walking toward
the door. He held his head down low.

The party stopped at a small brook. The woman who was leading the party
whispered, "Ok, if anybody's thirsty, this be a good time to drink. We keep moving
from here to the next station." This wind blew through the thick trees. A young boy
in the back of the party looked up at an older man and asked, "Is we really going to
be free?" The old man sighed, as if he could not believe it himself. "You see that star
up there? that's the North Star. We keep following that, and Miss Tubman up
there," he said gesturing to the woman leading the party. He continued, "We'll be
free alright." The boy smiled, and then something else occurred to him. He looked
up at the old man and said, "Well, what if we run into them slave catchers?" The
old man scratched his head and said, "Don't let them catch you."

May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long * *Master my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all *Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn" said the greedy camel. * There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger than you are. I think you should go outside." The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.

                                            W A man holding on to his jacket. (source: shutterstock.com) One morning, the Northwind and the Sun saw a man walking down a country road. He was wearing a new coat. "That young man looks very pleased with his new coat," said the Northwind. “But I could easily blow it off his back if I wanted to." "I don't think you could," said the Sun. "But let us see who of us can take off the coat." The Northwind began to blow hard. People had to chase after hats. Leaves were blown helplessly from the trees. The Northwind blew so mightily, but it was no use. The man just pulled his coat more tightly about him. "My turn now," cried the Sun. And he gave out his heat, gently at first. Insects hummed happily and flowers bloomed beautifully. The birds began to sing cheerfully. Then the Sun shone more strongly. Soon, the man began to feel very hot. "How hot and he took off his coat. pagtama po brainliest kopag mali nonse-report at walang brainliest​</a>

His facedisplays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and hisfiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensedand thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds ofa tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves thatcould crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up andhis hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressedinto the earth, therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. Hisblack tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floatsdown back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky.

One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said.

"Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal.

He died an extraordinary man of his times: renowned novelist, poet, ophthalmologist, journalist, and linguist. But behind these achievements, there remained the story of a man every Filipinocan relate and connect to. Like today's overseas Filipino, Rizal needed to leave his family to fulfill his studies and career abroad, suffering from homesickness, and enduring a long-distance relationship with the woman he loved most. He was also the best example of the Filipino who came back home and used the knowledge and skills he learned abroad to help improve the lives of his family and countrymen.1. Title of the movie2.

 The Wind and the Sun 
 The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man’s back the quickest. The wind began. He blew strong gust so fair, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. Then, the wind blew harder and longer. The harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was tired, but he could not remove the coat from the man’s back. It was now the sun’s turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shady tree.

the tables near him looked up from their books and gave him annoyed looks. Alex
realized that he had disturbed them and held up his hand apologetically. The
librarian turned toward him and

noise that he had made. Alex put the laptop in his bag and began walking toward
the door. He held his head down low.

in the back of the party looked up at an older man and asked, "Is we really going to
be free?" The old man sighed, as if he could not believe it himself. "You see that star
up there? that's the North Star. We keep following that, and Miss Tubman up

free alright." The boy smiled, and then something else occurred to him. He looked

                            30. W A man holding on to his jacket. (source: shutterstock.com) One morning, the Northwind and the Sun saw a man walking down a country road. He was wearing a new coat. "That young man looks very pleased with his new coat," said the Northwind. “But I could easily blow it off his back if I wanted to." "I don't think you could," said the Sun. "But let us see who of us can take off the coat." The Northwind began to blow hard. People had to chase after hats. Leaves were blown helplessly from the trees. The Northwind blew so mightily, but it was no use. The man just pulled his coat more tightly about him. "My turn now," cried the Sun. And he gave out his heat, gently at first. Insects hummed happily and flowers bloomed beautifully. The birds began to sing cheerfully. Then the Sun shone more strongly. Soon, the man began to feel very hot.
