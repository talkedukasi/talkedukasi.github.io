I am confident that you can do this review task without any problem. Directions: Analyze each statement below. Draw a smiley face if the statement is TRUE and sad face if the statement is FALSE. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. An earthquake is a vibration of the earth due to rapid release of energy. 2. Rocks along the fault move immediately because it has no friction that keeps them in place. 3. A fault is a break in the Earth's crust where significant movement has taken place. 4. When a fault suddenly moves, the energy released from inside the Earth causes the ground to move. 5. All movements along faults produce earthquake. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Earthquakes occur on faults - strike-slip earthquakes occur on strike-slip faults, normal earthquakes occur on normal faults, and thrust earthquakes occur on thrust or reverse faults. When an earthquake occurs on one of these faults, the rock on one side of the fault slips with respect to the other.</p><p></p><p>2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.seismic equipment is used to predict a trembler, it still can't prevent the mass destruction that results from the natural event. Because the earth's tectonic plates are continually moving and shifting, earthquake activity must continuously be monitored and tracked.</p><p>2.The epicenter is the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus.Focus-The location where the earthquake begins.(The focus is the point under ground where the earthquake rupture physically starts.
</p><p>
</p><p>The epicentre is the location of the focus on a map. Basically, epicentre + depth = focus.
</p><p>
</p><p>To expand on this, the focus is only where the earthquake starts, not really the ‘location’ of the earthquake, because an earthquake rupture has a physical size; and for large earthquakes (magnitude 7+), the focus and epicentre is not always a good indicator of where the worst damage may be because the strongest shaking could potentially be several hundred kilometres from the epicentre/focus, and possibly even on completely different faults.
</p><p>
</p><p>Some examples of this are the September 2010 earthquake in Canterbury, NZ, where the epicentre was about 10km north of the main rupture; the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, where the rupture moved primarily east of the epicentre, causing severe damage to Kathmandu, while Pokhara was relatively unscathed Matthew Bennett's answer to Why was Pokhara not affected by the earthquake even though epicenter is 77km far almost same as Kathmandu?; and the November 2016 Kaikoura earthquake in NZ, where more than 10 faults ruptured, some of them up to 200km north of the epicentre.
</p><p>
</p><p>Depth is important too. A magnitude 7 with a focus 5km deep will likely rupture to the surface, and could flatten a city, while a magnitude 7with a focus 200km deep is unlikely to do anything more than scare a few people.
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason the epicenter is used is because it is fairly easy to find using the time the first earthquake waves reach seismometers; it is usually a good indicator of where the worst damage will be; and people like to see a dot on a map they can point at.)-this is the whole explantion if you want to write this even if it is long-)</p><p>3.Magnitude is a measure of earthquake size and remains unchanged with distance from the earthquake. Intensity, however, describes the degree of shaking caused by an earthquake at a given place and decreases with distance from the earthquake epicentre.</p><p></p><p>

Directions: Analyze each statement below. Draw a smiley face if the statement is TRUE and sad face if the statement is FALSE. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. An earthquake is a vibration of the earth due to rapid release of energy. 2. Rocks along the fault move immediately because it has no friction that keeps them in place. 3.

How are rocks affected by different types of stress?4. Explain how movements along faults generate earthquakes? 5. Describe what happens to rock when it bends due to stress? 6. Explain how each type of fault changes the Earth's surface?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A fault is formed in the Earth's crust as a brittle response to stress. Generally, the movement of the tectonic plates provides the stress, and rocks at the surface break in response to this. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>2.  With normal faults, the hanging wall slips downward relative to the footwall.  Tensional stress is when rock slabs are pulled apart from each other, causing normal faults. These rocks move like your hands do when you rub them together to warm up. The movement along faults is what causes earthquakes.</p><p>3.</p><p><strong>Tension</strong> stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries.
</p><p><strong>Shear</strong> stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions. This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries.</p><p></p><p>4. Earthquakes are the result of sudden movement along faults within the Earth. The movement releases stored-up 'elastic strain' energy in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth and cause the ground surface to shake.</p><p></p><p>5. Folds. Rocks deforming plastically under compressive stresses crumple into folds. They do not return to their original shape. If the rocks experience more stress, they may undergo more folding or even fracture. Since the rock cannot move, it cannot deform. This is called confining stress. Compression squeezes rocks together, causing rocks to fold or fracture. Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries.</p><p></p><p>6. A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other.</p><br />

When the rock material is compressed or stretched, it will break and there will be earthquake. c.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Earthquakes occur on faults - strike-slip earthquakes occur on strike-slip faults, normal earthquakes occur on normal faults, and thrust earthquakes occur on thrust or reverse faults. When an earthquake occurs on one of these faults, the rock on one side of the fault slips with respect to the other. The fault surface can be vertical, horizontal, or at some angle to the surface of the earth. The slip direction can also be at any angle.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>24.
