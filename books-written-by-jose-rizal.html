During the middle part of the 19th century, while the Philippines was under a colonial rule, there was born a boy who would yearslater emerge as a great nationalist and one of the Filipino patriots to have fought for the emancipation of the natives from the bondageof colonization. He came to be known for his writings like the Noli Me Tangere. He was no less than Jose Rizal.2. As soon as the La Liga Filipina died a natural death with the exile of Jose Rizal in Dapitan, on July 7, 1892, the Kataastaasan,Kagaanggaangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan was organized with Andres Bonifacio as its founding leader. The allegedrevolutionary group anchored its existence from documents like the Kartilya ng Katipunan and its constitution and by-laws andpropagated its cause through its newspaper-the Kalayaan. These documents were crafted by the so called Brains of the Katipunanin the person of Apolinario Mabini.3. Andres Bonifacio was believed to have completed his primary education but failed to proceed to the secondary school. Despitethis academic handicap, he managed to read books and one of his favorite reading materials was a novel entitled Les Miserables.He must have drawn some inspiration from this novel that he was motivated to write a poem he entitled Pag-ibig sa TinubuangLupa, a poem which was given a beautiful music by the duo of Inang Laya. This is a fact or bluff?​</a>

During the middle part of the 19th century, while the Philippines was under a colonial rule, there was born a boy who would yearslater emerge as a great nationalist and one of the Filipino patriots to have fought for the emancipation of the natives from the bondageof colonization. He came to be known for his writings like the Noli Me Tangere. He was no less than Jose Rizal.2. As soon as the La Liga Filipina died a natural death with the exile of Jose Rizal in Dapitan, on July 7, 1892, the Kataastaasan,Kagaanggaangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan was organized with Andres Bonifacio as its founding leader. The allegedrevolutionary group anchored its existence from documents like the Kartilya ng Katipunan and its constitution and by-laws andpropagated its cause through its newspaper-the Kalayaan. These documents were crafted by the so called Brains of the Katipunanin the person of Apolinario Mabini.3. Andres Bonifacio was believed to have completed his primary education but failed to proceed to the secondary school. Despitethis academic handicap, he managed to read books and one of his favorite reading materials was a novel entitled Les Miserables.He must have drawn some inspiration from this novel that he was motivated to write a poem he entitled Pag-ibig sa TinubuangLupa, a poem which was given a beautiful music by the duo of Inang Laya. This is a fact or bluff?​</h2><br />
