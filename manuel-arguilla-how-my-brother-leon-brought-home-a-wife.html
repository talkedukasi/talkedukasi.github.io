                        The theme of 'How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife' is that one must preserve, even through certain sacrifices, in order to reach one's goal. In particular:<br /><br />- One may have to surrender a small part of one's life in order to be happy.<br /><br />In the story, Leon arrived with his wife in the country meeting Leon's brother for the first time. They took a surprising route home for Leon, but it was meant as a test for the wife to see if she could endure the sacrifices she made and meet her new family.<br /><br />The entire story serves as a test for the wife. Each test was to show whether the woman could indeed live with strangers all for love. This can be a secondary theme, but more importantly, it is a theme in which the main character learns that though there are sacrifices it is worth it in the end.<br /><br />He even begins to think about getting himself a wife eventually. This helps to show the theme and how it developed. He notices through all the tests the woman though afraid will preserve through the trials in order to be happy with Leon at his home.<br /><br />The fact that the country is different from the city can be somewhat daunting the closer they get to the home, but she still manages to overcome and under come any trials.<br /><br />The wife admits to having some fear, but also shows clearly it did not stop her. This is why the theme is related to how one may have to give up some things in order to find happiness in life or at least the best happiness that can be found in that particular life. The trials just add to the picture being offered by the author.<br /><br />-AND THAT'S MY OWN ANSWER-<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Manong Leon is Maria’s husband, the term “Manong” was used by his younger brother Baldo as a means of saying that he is older. Leon or Noel for Maria was to introduce his wife to his family. As they travel to the house with Baldo and Labang they saw stars, that wasn’t present in the city where Maria came from.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:<br />She stepped down from the carretela of Ca Celin with a quick, delicate grace. She was lovely. SHe was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>"You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand lightly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a small dimple appeared momently high on her right cheek.  "And this is Labang of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I laid a hand on Labang's massive neck and said to her: "You may scratch his forehead now."</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fingers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes half closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual fare from the station to the edge of Nagrebcan. Then he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her<br /><br />Explanation:<br />i hope its help</strong></p><br />

                            28. why should the story called how my brother leon brought home a wife by manuel arguilla should make into film​</h2><br />
                        <p>It's because the film has been <strong>approved</strong> or it has been <strong>accepted </strong>by the authorities. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>This is a very fascinating story to me. In our country, it is unusual to learn about a city girl falling in love with a provinciano.<p></p><p>According to my study, Leon's father welcomed Maria, which is a positive thing even if her life is not like theirs. One thing is certain: after reading this, I realized that it should make into film the particular circumstance for this reason is that loving someone is not full of expectations; you just have to trust the person you love, particularly when it comes to his own life, and you accept him because he demonstrates how he loves you for who you are in whatever way he feels is nice.</p><p> 1. The plot is intriguing.</p><p></p><p>2. It demonstrates Manuel Arguilla's love for his province.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants us to know that it is possible for a city girl and a provinciano to fall in love.</p><p></p><p>4. To gain a better understanding, use your imagination while reading this.</p><p></p><p>5. The best part of this story for me is that Maria accepts Leon for who he is, for the life he can give her, and most importantly, for the fact that he loves him despite the fact that he is only a provinciano.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>have a nice day and keep safe always ☺️❤️<br />
