                            5. recall the story of the monkey and the turtle distinguish the characteristics or attitude between the two characters in the story ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time there was a turtle who was very kind and patient. He had many friends. Among them was a monkey, who was very selfish. He always wanted to have the best part of everything.</p><p></p><p>One day the monkey went to visit the turtle. The monkey asked his friend to accompany him on a journey to the next village. The turtle agreed, and they started early the next morning. The monkey did not take much food with him, because he did not like to carry a heavy load. The turtle, on the contrary, took a big supply. He advised the monkey to take more, but the monkey only laughed at him. After they had been travelling five days, the monkey's food was all gone, so the turtle had to give him some. The monkey was greedy, and kept asking for more all the time. "Give me some more, friend turtle!" he said.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a little while," said the turtle. "We have just finished eating."</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>As the monkey made no reply, they travelled on. After a few minutes the monkey stopped, and said, "Can't you travel a little faster?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't, for I have a very heavy load," said the turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Give me the load, and then we shall get along more rapidly," said the monkey. The turtle handed over all his food to the monkey, who ran away as fast as he could, leaving the turtle far behind.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!" said the turtle, doing his best to catch his friend; but the monkey only shouted, "Come on!" and scampered [370]out of sight. The turtle was soon very tired and much out of breath, but he kept on. The monkey climbed a tree by the roadside, and looked back. When he saw his friend very far in the rear, he ate some of the food. At last the turtle came up. He was very hungry, and asked the monkey for something to eat.</p><p></p><p>"Come on a little farther," said the selfish monkey. "We will eat near a place where we can get water." The turtle did not say anything, but kept plodding on. The monkey ran ahead and did the same thing as before, but this time he ate all the food.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come so late?" said the monkey when the turtle came up panting.</p><p></p><p>"Because I am so hungry that I cannot walk fast," answered the turtle. "Will you give me some food?" he continued.</p><p></p><p>"There is no more," replied the monkey. "You brought very little. I ate all there was, and I am still hungry."</p><p></p><p>As the turtle had no breath to waste, he continued on the road. While they were on their way, they met a hunter. The monkey saw the hunter and climbed a tree, but the man caught the turtle and took it home with him. The monkey laughed at his friend's misfortune. But the hunter was kind to the turtle: he tied it near a banana-tree, and gave it food every hour.</p><p></p><p>One day the monkey happened to pass near the house of the hunter. When he saw that his friend was tied fast, he sneered at him; but after he had remained there a few hours, and had seen how the turtle was fed every hour, he envied the turtle's situation. So when night came, and the hunter was asleep, the monkey went up to the turtle, and said, "Let me be in your place."</p><p></p><p>"No, I like this place," answered the turtle.</p><p></p><p>The monkey, however, kept urging and begging the turtle, so that finally the turtle yielded. Then the monkey set the turtle free, and tied himself to the tree. The turtle went off happy; and the monkey was so pleased, that he could hardly sleep during the night for thinking of the food the hunter would give him in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning the hunter woke and looked out of his window. He caught sight of the monkey, and thought that the animal was stealing his bananas. So he took his gun and shot him dead. Thus the turtle became free, and the monkey was killed.</p><p></p><p>MORAL: Do not be selfish.</p><p>Sources:</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Summary of the story (The Monkey and the Turtle)<p></p><p><strong>A very ancient and well-known animal tale is "The Tortoise and the Monkey" made fan by Dr. dose Rizal.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle and Monkey
</strong></p><p><strong>A Filipino folk tale told by David Heathfield
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey stood at the edge of the river and watched Turtle swimming against the torrent with a tree that he had caught in the flood: a young tree.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Oh, Monkey, I have caught a banana tree. Monkey, will you help me to drag it to the clearing and plant it? It will grow and there will be sweet bananas.’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle pulled the tree by its heavy end – the roots and the trunk – across the ground. Monkey carried just a couple of green fronds from the top end of the tree.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Lazy Monkey.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When Turtle wasn’t looking, Monkey jumped onto the fronds.
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey nimble, Monkey quick, Monkey play a monkey trick – and was pulled along by Turtle to the clearing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle made a hole. He pulled the tree down into the hole and pressed the earth down around it. ‘Soon it will grow, Monkey. We will tend the tree together. We will water it. We will weed around it. We will share the bananas.’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Share the tree,’ said Monkey. ‘Very well.’ And Monkey climbed half way up the tree, just below where the green fronds grew, and with his strong hands he broke off the top of the tree and ran away with it, laughing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>He pressed his half, the top half, into the damp earth. Soon he would have bananas, he thought.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle tended the bottom half of the tree. There was no green.
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle wisdom, Turtle slow, Turtle knows what turtles know.
</strong></p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p><strong>Time passed, and the bottom half of the tree began to green up. Fronds appeared and green bananas began to grow.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey, with the top half of the tree, had green fronds that wilted and died. There was nothing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle worked hard around his tree, weeding it and watering it, and now big, long, yellow bananas were hanging down in bunches.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Oh, Monkey, won’t you help me? Climb the tree and pick the bananas. I cannot climb the tree.’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey nimble, Monkey quick, Monkey play a monkey trick – up the tree he went to the top, and there he picked one banana and peeled it and ate the delicious fruit. He tossed down the skin so it struck Turtle upon his shell.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey took another banana and ate it, tossing the skin down upon the shell of Turtle. Banana after banana…
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey nimble, Monkey quick, Monkey play a monkey trick.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But Turtle, without Monkey noticing, went and fetched thorns and placed them around the trunk of the banana tree…
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle wisdom, Turtle slow, Turtle knows what turtles know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When Monkey had finished and was fat, had eaten all of the yellow bananas, he jumped down from the tree… ‘Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The thorns stuck in the bottom of his feet as he ran. He sat down and he pulled the thorns from his feet and he was full of anger. He ran and quickly, quickly caught Turtle.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘I am going to carry you to the cliffs and dash you down upon the rocks so your shell breaks! I’m going to take you to the top of the mountain of fire and throw you into the flames!’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Yes, yes, said Turtle, throw me into the flames! Yes, dash me from the cliff onto the rocks! But whatever you do, Monkey, don’t throw me into the torrent of the river.’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Ah, that’s what you’re afraid of,’ said Monkey.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Monkey ran, carrying Turtle to the edge of the river, and tossed him high into the air. Turtle landed with a splash in the deep waters and sank down… and then rose to the surface.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle relaxes‘Oh, Monkey, don’t you know that Turtles love to swim in the river.’
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Turtle wisdom, Turtle slow, Turtle knows what turtles know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But what of the banana tree?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Turtle and the Monkey did not work together, and the tree was grown over with weeds.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>No more bananas.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Once upon a time there lived a monkey and a turtle who were very close friends. Every day they always carry out activities together ranging from playing to looking for food. One day they also found some banana seeds and intended to plant them in their respective homes.</p><p>Monkeys and turtles planted the banana seeds they got. The turtles take care of the banana seeds that are planted by regularly watering them every day. While the monkeys are not diligent in caring for the banana seeds and only water them once a week.</p><p>One day, the monkey went to the turtle's house and saw a big banana tree. Incidentally, the turtle also asked the monkey for help to pick ripe bananas. "My good friend, will you pick the banana for me, no need to worry because you will also be giving your share."</p><p>The monkey was willing, and in his heart he intended to take all the fruit on the tree. Once up on the tree, the monkey ate all the bananas. The tortoise was shocked and angry with the monkey's behavior.</p><p>The monkey ignored the turtle and continued to eat the banana until it was full. But without realizing it, one of the pusang's branches broke and finally the branch fell with the monkey. The monkey grimaced in pain because his spine was broken.</p><p></p><p><strong>Moral Message of a  Story</strong>: Don't be greedy for something, especially if it belongs to someone else because later it can harm ourselves and can hurt other people's feelings.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Monkey and the Turtle is a Filipino fable. </strong>It involves a turtle outwitting a monkey on a banana tree.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time there was a turtle who was very kind and patient. He had many friends. Among them was a monkey, who was very selfish. He always wanted to have the best part of everything.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day the monkey went to visit the turtle. The monkey asked his friend to accompany him on a journey to the next village. The turtle agreed, and they started early the next morning. The monkey did not take much food with him, because he did not like to carry a heavy load. The turtle, on the contrary, took a big supply. He advised the monkey to take more, but the monkey only laughed at him. After they had been travelling five days, the monkey's food was all gone, so the turtle had to give him some. The monkey was greedy, and kept asking for more all the time. "Give me some more, friend turtle!" he said.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Wait a little while," said the turtle. "We have just finished eating."
</p><p>
</p><p>As the monkey made no reply, they travelled on. After a few minutes the monkey stopped, and said, "Can't you travel a little faster?"
</p><p>
</p><p>"I can't, for I have a very heavy load," said the turtle.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Give me the load, and then we shall get along more rapidly," said the monkey. The turtle handed over all his food to the monkey, who ran away as fast as he could, leaving the turtle far behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Wait for me!" said the turtle, doing his best to catch his friend; but the monkey only shouted, "Come on!" and scampered [370]out of sight. The turtle was soon very tired and much out of breath, but he kept on. The monkey climbed a tree by the roadside, and looked back. When he saw his friend very far in the rear, he ate some of the food. At last the turtle came up. He was very hungry, and asked the monkey for something to eat.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Come on a little farther," said the selfish monkey. "We will eat near a place where we can get water." The turtle did not say anything, but kept plodding on. The monkey ran ahead and did the same thing as before, but this time he ate all the food.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Why did you come so late?" said the monkey when the turtle came up panting.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Because I am so hungry that I cannot walk fast," answered the turtle. "Will you give me some food?" he continued.
</p><p>
</p><p>"There is no more," replied the monkey. "You brought very little. I ate all there was, and I am still hungry."
</p><p>
</p><p>As the turtle had no breath to waste, he continued on the road. While they were on their way, they met a hunter. The monkey saw the hunter and climbed a tree, but the man caught the turtle and took it home with him. The monkey laughed at his friend's misfortune. But the hunter was kind to the turtle: he tied it near a banana-tree, and gave it food every hour.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day the monkey happened to pass near the house of the hunter. When he saw that his friend was tied fast, he sneered at him; but after he had remained there a few hours, and had seen how the turtle was fed every hour, he envied the turtle's situation. So when night came, and the hunter was asleep, the monkey went up to the turtle, and said, "Let me be in your place."
</p><p>
</p><p>"No, I like this place," answered the turtle.
</p><p>
</p><p>The monkey, however, kept urging and begging the turtle, so that finally the turtle yielded. Then the monkey set the turtle free, and tied himself to the tree. The turtle went off happy; and the monkey was so pleased, that he could hardly sleep during the night for thinking of the food the hunter would give him in the morning.
</p><p>
</p><p>Early the next morning the hunter woke and looked out of his window. He caught sight of the monkey, and thought that the animal was stealing his bananas. So he took his gun and shot him dead. Thus the turtle became free, and the monkey was killed.

Turtle landed with a splash in the deep waters and sank down… and then rose to the surface.<br /><br />Turtle relaxes‘Oh, Monkey, don’t you know that Turtles love to swim in the river.’<br /><br />Turtle wisdom, Turtle slow, Turtle knows what turtles know.<br /><br />But what of the banana tree?<br /><br />The Turtle and the Monkey did not work together, and the tree was grown over with weeds.<br /><br />No more bananas.<br />
