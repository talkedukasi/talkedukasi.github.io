                                            2. A functioning ecosystem uses both energy and recycling of chemical nutrients necessary for
life. Chemical nutrients in the form of carbon dioxide, water, oxygen, and other important
minerals however, need not be supplied from the outside; they are obtained from the
physical environment and flow through the ecosystem in a cyclical manner. Thus, in a
"balanced" ecosystem, materials are never lost; they are continually recycled. Since life is
also a cycle, how do you look forward and see yourself in the near future? Explain.

                                            1.Life on Earth is sustained by combination of two interconnected factors - energy from the
sun and cycling of nutrients. Energy flows in ecosystem through the interactions of organism
within an ecosystem. All organisms need energy to survive and this energy is passed from
one organism to another as food. We humans are one of these organisms who live in a
community where interactions are needed to obtain one's needs. In some point, energy in
humans represents as motivation to do, to be, or to be more of something, it can also be
transferred not only by the means of food or sunlight but also by inspiring others. How can
you transfer your energy to motivate others, especially to your classmates when you see
them unhappy or lonely? Explain?

                                            Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem. Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).
Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.
Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.
Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.
Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.
Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.
Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.
Abiotic Components
Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem. It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc. 
Functions of Ecosystem
The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:
It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.
It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.
It maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem.
It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.
The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy.
So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:
Productivity – It refers to the rate of biomass production.
Energy flow – It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.
Decomposition – It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.
Nutrient cycling – In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilisation by various organisms.</a>

[ ]Photosynthetic organisms (such as algae and plants) are able to capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy, which is stored in the molecules of organic substances. This process is called photosynthesis. [ ] In a food chain, the amount of energy from one trophic level is always greater than the energy that can be transferred to the next level, since all living beings consume part of the energy of food for the maintenance of their own life. [ ] The transfer of energy in the food chain is unidirectional; it begins with the producing organisms, passes to the consumers and ends with the decomposing organisms. [ ] Primary consumers obtain the energy necessary for their survival by feeding directly on photosynthetic organisms. [ ] Decomposing organisms obtain the energy necessary for their survival through the decomposition of dead organic matter.​</a>

within an ecosystem. All organisms need energy to survive and this energy is passed from
one organism to another as food. We humans are one of these organisms who live in a
community where interactions are needed to obtain one's needs. In some point, energy in
humans represents as motivation to do, to be, or to be more of something, it can also be

                            15. Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem. Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).
Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.
Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.
Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.
Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.
Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.
Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.
Abiotic Components
Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem. It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc. 
Functions of Ecosystem
The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:
It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.
It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.
It maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem.
It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.
The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy.
So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:
Productivity – It refers to the rate of biomass production.
Energy flow – It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.
Decomposition – It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.
Nutrient cycling – In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilisation by various organisms.</h2><br />

What might happen if the sun stops emitting energy in the ecosystem ?</p><p>- This will occur in around 5 billion years when the sun quits delivering hotness and its atomic combination and center become unsound and contract. As indicated by NASA, while this is going on, the external portion of the sun will in any case contain hydrogen and will extend and sparkle red as it cools, which is normal for a star.</p><p>2. Explain what might happen if there is no rainfall for several months in the ecosystem?</p><p>- There are so many things that can occur without a trace of downpour, Firstly there will be starvation, this is on the grounds that the creation in the ranches will be low because of no downpour. Extensive stretch of no downpour might prompt the conclusion of certain enterprises and production lines. The enterprises that utilizes an excess of water will be compelled to stop.</p><p>3. Explain what might happen if people will throw their garbage and other waste materials in the ecosystem ? How will it affect the fishes and other life forms that live in that particular ecosystem?</p><p>- The waste people create squander has been hindering to our current circumstance for a long while presently. People are creating an excessive amount of waste and can't manage it in a feasible manner. Squander that isn't biodegradable and can't be as expected be reused is filling our seas and landfills.</p><p>4. Why should people need to understand the effect of changes in abiotic factors in the ecosystem? How important is it to people’s lives?​</p><p>- Abiotic factors impact the progression of connection in a climate so it is a significant move to concentrate on their consequences for living creatures. Abiotic or Nonliving things play an indispensable part in keeping up with the equilibrium of the environment. The elements of Abiotic have changed parts and angle in the actual climate on what they mean for biotic variables.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#brainlyeveryday</p><br />

                            28. Analyze the propositions below, regarding energy in ecosystems and enter true or false. [ ]Photosynthetic organisms (such as algae and plants) are able to capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy, which is stored in the molecules of organic substances. This process is called photosynthesis. [ ] In a food chain, the amount of energy from one trophic level is always greater than the energy that can be transferred to the next level, since all living beings consume part of the energy of food for the maintenance of their own life. [ ] The transfer of energy in the food chain is unidirectional; it begins with the producing organisms, passes to the consumers and ends with the decomposing organisms. [ ] Primary consumers obtain the energy necessary for their survival by feeding directly on photosynthetic organisms. [ ] Decomposing organisms obtain the energy necessary for their survival through the decomposition of dead organic matter.​</h2><br />
                        <p>A food chain is a series of relationships between living beings in which one feeds on the other and there is a unidirectional flow of energy. About the energy of ecosystems, <strong>(all statements are true.)</strong></p><p></p><p>The first trophic level of the food chain is composed of producers, photosynthetic living beings that produce their own food from the absorption of solar energy.</p><p></p><p>In the food chain, the flow of energy is unidirectional. That is, we find a greater amount of energy in the producers. This energy decreases as it advances through the other trophic levels, finding its lowest concentration when it is absorbed by decomposers.</p><p></p><p>Primary consumers are all living things that feed on producers (photosynthetic organisms). Secondary consumers are those that feed on secondary consumers and decomposers are organisms that break down organic matter into inorganic matter.</p><p></p><p>#LetTheEarthBreathe</p><br />
