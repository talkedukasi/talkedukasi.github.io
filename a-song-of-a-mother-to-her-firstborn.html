Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5.

Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire. He, still a teenager wants to marry the girl of his dreams, Tena.Dodong realizes how history is repeating itself and warns Blas about the consequences of such a massive decision.

                            5. What significant tradition is followed by the Franklin clan regarding their firstborn male child?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the tradition is followed by Franklin is canvas painted in Paris Circa 1785</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Franklin, of course, was a transplanted Pennsylvanian. Born in Boston, he was raised in a devout Puritan home. His father, Josiah, was a member of Boston's Old South Church who raised his son on the teachings of New England Calvinism. God was sovereign. Human beings were separated from God because of their sin. God, in his divine mercy, however, chose to offer salvation to humankind through the death and resurrection of his only son, Jesus Christ. Men and women were required to perform good works in the world, but any attempt in doing them without the aid of the Holy Spirit would be useless in the eyes of God.</p><p></p><p>Josiah Franklin saw spiritual potential in his youngest son, and set him on a course toward the Congregational ministry. When he could no longer afford the cost of Benjamin's schooling, the senior Franklin was forced to apprentice him to his older brother James, a Boston printer and the publisher of the New England Courant. Franklin would never escape the faith of his youth. The work ethic he espoused was similar to the so-called Puritan work ethic that he had learned growing up in New England, and he never seemed to have fully relinquished a belief in the sovereignty of God over the world and its inhabitants.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On June 28, 1787, Franklin delivered a speech in which he asked fellow delegates to the Constitutional Convention to open each day's session with a prayer. His motion failed, ostensibly because the Convention had no funds to pay local clergymen to act as chaplains. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</p><p>At the age of fifteen, Franklin read a series of lectures, published by the estate of British scientist Robert Boyle (1627–1691), designed to counter the influence of Deism in English religious life. Deism was the belief that God created the world and allowed it to operate according to natural laws. Deists believed God did not intervene in the lives of his human creation. He did not perform miracles, answer prayer, or sustain the world by his providence. Religious belief was based on reason rather than divine revelation. In his Autobiography, Franklin wrote that these lectures "wrought an Effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them: For the Arguments of the Deists which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much Stronger than the Refutation." He claimed he had become a "thorough Deist."</p><p></p><p>Franklin's early commitments to Deism did not last long. His flirtation with this world view was little more than a form of youthful rebellion against the Calvinism of his Puritan upbringing. Although he never returned to the Calvinism of his childhood, the religion of his parents leavened much of his adult thinking. Franklin believed in a Creator - God who possessed great wisdom, goodness, and power. This God not only created the world, but sustained it. Franklin was amazed, for example, at the way God created the stars and the planets, but was even more amazed that God continued "to govern them in their greatest Velocity as they shall not flie off out of their appointed Bounds nor dash one against another, to their mutual Destruction."</p><p></p><p>Franklin put his faith in an active God who watched over his natural creation and could, on occasion, intervene in the lives of his human creation as well. Thirty-six years after he claimed to embrace Deism, Franklin sounded like anything but an adherent to this religious system. "Without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance of, guards and guides, and may favour particular Persons, there is no Motive to Worship a Deity, to fear its Displeasure, or to pray for its Protection," he wrote. This was also a God who answered prayer. Franklin wrote prayers for his own personal</p><br />

                            26. GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5.

Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire. He, still a teenager wants to marry the girl of his dreams, Tena.Dodong realizes how history is repeating itself and warns Blas about the consequences of such a massive decision.
