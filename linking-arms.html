Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6.

Terrorism and Counterterrorism
On May 23, after Islamist rebels took over the predominantly Muslim city of Marawi, Mindanao, the Philippine government launched a counterattack. The fighting destroyed the city and left at least 1,112 people dead, mostly alleged rebels but also civilians and government soldiers, the government said. The government’s figures could not be independently verified.
The fighting has displaced more than 400,000 residents of the city and nearby towns, many of whom were living in overcrowded evacuation camps. Duterte declared martial law across the entire Mindanao region in response to the fighting. The rebels, known as the Maute group, are residents of Marawi and nearby provinces who linked with elements of the Abu Sayyaf armed group, which had earlier pledged support for the extremist group Islamic State (ISIS).</a>

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6.

Terrorism and Counterterrorism
On May 23, after Islamist rebels took over the predominantly Muslim city of Marawi, Mindanao, the Philippine government launched a counterattack. The fighting destroyed the city and left at least 1,112 people dead, mostly alleged rebels but also civilians and government soldiers, the government said. The government’s figures could not be independently verified.
The fighting has displaced more than 400,000 residents of the city and nearby towns, many of whom were living in overcrowded evacuation camps. Duterte declared martial law across the entire Mindanao region in response to the fighting. The rebels, known as the Maute group, are residents of Marawi and nearby provinces who linked with elements of the Abu Sayyaf armed group, which had earlier pledged support for the extremist group Islamic State (ISIS).</h2><br />
