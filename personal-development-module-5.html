                        <p><strong>Answer:1. Narrative text (Topic: An Adventure Story)  &gt; At April 29, 2021, My friend celebrated his 16th birthday, he invited me over and my other friends to eat food and watch movies for his birthday. And so before I went to the party, I went to the National book store to at least buy him a simple gift, and so I bought  happy birthday card for him and I also bought a confetti so that me and my friends can surprise him at his birthday. When we came to his birthday he was so shocked because we played song that made him cringe and popped the confetti right after his face. After celebrating his special day, his mom gave us some food so that we can bring them home and eat them whenever we are hungry, then we all greeted him for the last time and went home.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Explanatory text (Topic: Water Cycle)</strong></p><p><strong> &gt;The water cycle is powered by the sun's energy and gravity. The sun kickstarts the whole cycle by heating all the Earth's water and making it evaporate. Gravity makes the moisture fall back to Earth.There are four main stages in the water cycle. They are evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection. Let's look at each of these stages. </strong></p><p><strong> Evaporation: This is when warmth from the sun causes water from oceans, lakes, streams, ice and soils to rise into the air and turn into water vapour (gas). Water vapour droplets join together to make clouds!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Condensation: : This is when water vapor in the air cools down and turns back into liquid water.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Precipitation:  This is when water (in the form of rain, snow, hail or sleet) falls from clouds in the sky.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Collection: This is when water that falls from the clouds as rain, snow, hail or sleet, collects in the oceans, rivers, lakes, streams. Most will infiltrate (soak into) the ground and will collect as underground water.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The water cycle is powered by the sun's energy and gravity. The sun kickstarts the whole cycle by heating all the Earth's water and making it evaporate. Gravity makes the moisture fall back to Earth.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Factual and Personal Recounts (Topic: Favorite Holiday Memory)  &gt; My favorite holiday memory is having Christmas at my grandparents house, because me and my cousin had so much fun playing all night long playing tag and playing video games, we also shared our memories together we also told each other our secrets and our crushes, we even gave each other gifts. We stayed at our grandmas house for 1 week and it was the best holiday ever!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4.Persuasive text (Topic: Keeping Yourself Healthy)  &gt;Staying healthy physically can help you stay healthy emotionally too. If you're eating the right food and keeping fit, your body will be strong and help you to cope with stress and also fight illness. Eating well and exercising often when you're a teenager will also help you stay in good health later in life. So start eating more vegetables, fruits and also take vitamins to maintain your strong body. also stop doing your bad habits if you have one, like for examples drinking, smoking, doing drugs, etc. stop it! so that you can start a healthy life style and live long.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5. Expository Text (Topic: Three Reasons Why Learners should Use Modules)  &gt;Because   1.) it provides an aid in the presentation and application of the online teaching and learning process.  2.) The majority of students  rely on the lecture notes, reference and text books study materials at large to maintain good performance in their studies.  3.) Research findings show that course module is useful academically up to some level in improving the standards of students.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>~Narrative text- (narrative) a spoken or written account of connected events; a story.</p><p>~Explanatory text- serving to explain something.</p><p>~Factual and Personal Recounts</p><p>&gt;A factual recount is an objective recount of a true event by someone not personally involved in the situation.
