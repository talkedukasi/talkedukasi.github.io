                                            36. The relationship between the human self and the environment has led the mergence and the development of the various approaches to nature. The understanding of these approaches might be useful to encourage someone to conserve, protect, and preserve the environment, EXCEPT one. *
a. Utilitarianism
b. Natural Ethics
c. Instrumental Approach
d. Virtue Ethics Perspective
37. In utilitarian approach, action is ethically right when it produces greatest happiness for the greater number of people. In that sense, do you consider it as just and ethical to build more infrastructures (e.g. buildings, expressways, etc.) for human development at the expense of the environment? *
a. Yes, because it could generate income thus, it helps the economy to grow and prosper.
b. Yes, because in the end a lot of people can benefit from these infrastructures in one way or another.
c. No, but if they only choose small portion of land to build the infrastructures then it is just reasonable and fine.
d. No, because in the long run, most of us will suffer from the consequences of our actions as human beings continuously prioritizing development over the environment.
38. Human beings are considered as the summit of creation that grants us the freedom and full authority to control the His creation thus, we are permitted to use the environment by any means possible. Is this statement always, correct? *
a. No, because our control and authority are only limited to the non-human beings and not directly to the environment itself.
b. Yes, the Divine Creator has granted us this power of free will and reason and it is up to us as to how we make use of His Creation by any means possible.
c. Yes, because we are created by His image and likeness, and we are tasked to rule over His creation. Thus, we are allowed to do anything we want to the environment and even to the non-human beings.
d. No, because as stewards of God, though we have the freedom and authority to control over His creation, we are always reminded about our moral responsibility to take care, protect, and respect the environment and not to use it for own expense.
39. There is an ongoing project on your Barangay yet, you overheard what this project is all about and has the potential to harm the environment. As a SK councilor, what will you do? *
a. Neglect the information and act as if that you don’t hear anything.
b. Tell everyone in community that your Brgy. Captain has bad intentions to the environment you are living.
c. Ask the other barangay officials if there is any way possible for this project not to push through
d. Talk with the Brgy. Captain and ask the nature of the project. If what he heard was right, you and the other SK Councilors must come up with a proposed project proposal, that would aim not just for development but also to live sustainably.

b. Natural Ethics
c. Instrumental Approach
d. Virtue Ethics Perspective

a. Yes, because it could generate income thus, it helps the economy to grow and prosper.
b. Yes, because in the end a lot of people can benefit from these infrastructures in one way or another.
c. No, but if they only choose small portion of land to build the infrastructures then it is just reasonable and fine.
d. No, because in the long run, most of us will suffer from the consequences of our actions as human beings continuously prioritizing development over the environment.
38. Human beings are considered as the summit of creation that grants us the freedom and full authority to control the His creation thus, we are permitted to use the environment by any means possible. Is this statement always, correct? *

b. Yes, the Divine Creator has granted us this power of free will and reason and it is up to us as to how we make use of His Creation by any means possible.
c. Yes, because we are created by His image and likeness, and we are tasked to rule over His creation. Thus, we are allowed to do anything we want to the environment and even to the non-human beings.
d. No, because as stewards of God, though we have the freedom and authority to control over His creation, we are always reminded about our moral responsibility to take care, protect, and respect the environment and not to use it for own expense.
39. There is an ongoing project on your Barangay yet, you overheard what this project is all about and has the potential to harm the environment. As a SK councilor, what will you do? *
a. Neglect the information and act as if that you don’t hear anything.
b. Tell everyone in community that your Brgy. Captain has bad intentions to the environment you are living.
c. Ask the other barangay officials if there is any way possible for this project not to push through
d. Talk with the Brgy. Captain and ask the nature of the project. If what he heard was right, you and the other SK Councilors must come up with a proposed project proposal, that would aim not just for development but also to live sustainably.
40. The following situations shows prudence towards the environment, EXCEPT one. *
a. Mika is milk tea lover so she always buys it every other day. She realized that she always consumes plastic from its container down to the straw, that’s why she decided to bring her own container and metal straw next time.
b. Cindy is a real estate developer. In order to make more profits, she usually goes to vacant lands and mountainous areas that no one seems to own and cut down the trees endlessly to build some homes and other infrastructures to generate more income.
c. Andrew buys his conditioner and shampoo in a sari-sari store nearby. Eventually, he realized that a lot of plastics have been used because of its container, that’s why he decided to go instead to the supermarket every month and buy shampoo, conditioner, and other stuff in bulks.
d. Hannah is the town mayor of one of the cities in Cebu. She noticed that it became hotter in the surrounding areas, and the pollution worsens, when they started building the expressway above the river. Because of that, although it benefitted a lot of people from the past years, she decided to tear it down and restore the river again and decided to make it as a green space instead.</h2><br />
