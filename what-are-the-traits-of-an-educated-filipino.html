                                            What are characteristic of an effective paragraph (organization, coherence and cohesion, unity, language use, mechanics) is most will manifested in the paragraphs below.The physical build of the Filipino, notwithstanding the strong racial crossing with Westerners, remains decidedly Oriental. The mestizo even retains some characteristics of the white ancestor, but his build, his nervous system, his bodily movements deflect very sensibly towards the Oriental. Even the children of pure Westem parents soften into a mild complexion. This phenomenon, that to a certain extent, is experienced by all the residents in this part of the world sometime after their arrival...is a natural consequence of the nutrition and of the physical milieu. Therefore, the psychosomatic functioning of the Filipino is fundamentally Oriental, no matter how Western his ideas or his education may be. -Jesus M.

                            5. What are characteristic of an effective paragraph (organization, coherence and cohesion, unity, language use, mechanics) is most will manifested in the paragraphs below.The physical build of the Filipino, notwithstanding the strong racial crossing with Westerners, remains decidedly Oriental. The mestizo even retains some characteristics of the white ancestor, but his build, his nervous system, his bodily movements deflect very sensibly towards the Oriental. Even the children of pure Westem parents soften into a mild complexion. This phenomenon, that to a certain extent, is experienced by all the residents in this part of the world sometime after their arrival...is a natural consequence of the nutrition and of the physical milieu. Therefore, the psychosomatic functioning of the Filipino is fundamentally Oriental, no matter how Western his ideas or his education may be. -Jesus M.
