Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</a>

                                             the following concepts to fully analyze assertions. Common Types of Assertions 1. Fact This is a statement that can be proven objectively by direct experience, testimonies of witnesses, verified observations, or the results of research. Example: The sampaguita’s roots are used for medicinal purposes, such as an anesthetic and a sedative. 2. Convention It is a way in which something is done, like traditions and norms. Conventions depend on historical precedent, laws, rules, usage, and customs. Example: The sampaguita belongs to the genus Jasminum of the family Oleaceae. 3. Opinion It is based on facts but is difficult to objectively verify because of the uncertainty of producing satisfactory proofs of soundness. Example: The popularity of sampaguita flowers is most evident in places of worship. 4. Preference It is based on personal choice; therefore, they are subjective and cannot be objectively proven or logically attacked. Example: Sampaguitas are the most beautiful and most fragrant of all flowers. ​</a>

Then, fill in the blanks with the letters of the words from the pool of choices below to complete the passage: A. Explanatory C. Expository B. Persuasive D. Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many currently available drugs show unfavourable physicochemical properties for delivery into or across the skin and temporary chemical modulation of the penetrant is one option to achieve improved delivery properties. Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>i i hope i can help </p><p></p><br />
