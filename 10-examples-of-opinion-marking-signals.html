Importance of Reading and Writing Is the ability to read and write more important today than in the past? Everyone has his answer depending on his experience and lifestyle. Some people think it is true because people need not read and write in past. On the contrary, other people believe there is no big difference between today and yesterday. As far as I am concerned, I would like to say that reading and writing are getting more important in our life day by day. In the following discussion, I will provide some reasons and examples to support my viewpoints. The main reason for my propensity is that knowledge is very important to us today. Without education, it is very hard to find a good job and you will have a hard time to do the work. There is too much new knowledge today. In the past days, people can teach each other orally, therefore, reading and writing is not as important as now. However, if you enter a company today, your supervisor will only give you an instruction book and tell you to study it. Nobody has time to teach you orally. If you can read and write well, you will get more smoothly at work. Communication is another head and chief reason I have chosen to include here. Many professions require people to work in teams to solve problems and make decisions. Reading and writing can help you to know what your other colleagues are doing. On the other hand, it can also help you to tell other people what you have done and what you plan to do next. To be honest, I cannot deny that some people who cannot read or write also have a nice life today Nevertheless, for the normal people, the benefits of reading and writing carry much more weight than the illiterates, so the conclusion is obvious. For all factors presented​</a>

Importance of Reading and Writing Is the ability to read and write more important today than in the past? Everyone has his answer depending on his experience and lifestyle. Some people think it is true because people need not read and write in past. On the contrary, other people believe there is no big difference between today and yesterday. As far as I am concerned, I would like to say that reading and writing are getting more important in our life day by day. In the following discussion, I will provide some reasons and examples to support my viewpoints. The main reason for my propensity is that knowledge is very important to us today. Without education, it is very hard to find a good job and you will have a hard time to do the work. There is too much new knowledge today. In the past days, people can teach each other orally, therefore, reading and writing is not as important as now. However, if you enter a company today, your supervisor will only give you an instruction book and tell you to study it. Nobody has time to teach you orally. If you can read and write well, you will get more smoothly at work. Communication is another head and chief reason I have chosen to include here. Many professions require people to work in teams to solve problems and make decisions. Reading and writing can help you to know what your other colleagues are doing. On the other hand, it can also help you to tell other people what you have done and what you plan to do next. To be honest, I cannot deny that some people who cannot read or write also have a nice life today Nevertheless, for the normal people, the benefits of reading and writing carry much more weight than the illiterates, so the conclusion is obvious. For all factors presented​</h2><br />
