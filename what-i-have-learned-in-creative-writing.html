                        <p><strong>Friction</strong> is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It is not a fundamental force, like gravity or electromagnetism. Instead, scientists believe it is the result of the electromagnetic attraction between charged particles in two touching surfaces. Friction is used in car brakes, when we walk or climb a hill, making a fire, skiing down a hill, and more.</p><p>Examples:</p>Rubbing both hands together to create heat.A sled sliding across snow or ice.Skis sliding against snow.<p></p><p><strong>Gravity</strong> is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. I learned that friction and gravity have a lot of purpose to us. It helps us in our daily lives. </p><p></p><p>2. By learning more about friction, we are aware of the cons and prons that it may bring to us. We now know the reason why we use lubricants to make the floor slippery or why our hands heat after rubbing it for a long time.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today, I will make a commitment to take 30 minutes or more a day for me. In that time, I will not have my phone on and will do everything in my power not to be distracted by the outside world. I will use this time to show myself love, respect, care, and loyalty. I will do this because it is exactly what I deserve. I will not be too busy and ignore my own personal needs. I know that by being there for myself I will be able to show up more for all the people in my life. I will have a clearer vision of who should and shouldn’t stay in my life. </p><p>I’m taking care of myself because I have a responsibility to myself in order to live the best life possible and fulfill my purpose with love and integrity. I’ve seen what happens when I don’t take care of myself and how it affects all the people in my life. By committing to myself, I’m committing to the betterment of all. </p><p>I promise to be aware and pay attention to the signs when I’m not taking care of myself. I will not be hard on myself or abuse myself in any way. I will find my way to take one step in the right direction to put the focus back on me and commit to my journey one hour at a time. I know I need to slow down and be present, so I will commit to taking three deep breaths as a part of being there for myself. This gives me enough time to slow down and re-evaluate the situation. </p><p>I’m worth the care I give to everyone else. I’m worth the love I give to everyone else. I’m worth the respect I give to everyone else. I’m worth the compassion I give to everyone else. From this day forward, I will give myself these things by taking good care of me. </p><p>I know the more time I give myself, the more space will open up for positive things to come into my life. I will no longer be wasting my energy on being the victim of what everyone else wants. I will be the champion for me. I will give to others in a way that fills me up and doesn’t deplete me. This is the reward for taking care of myself. </p><p>It is not my business how other people take this change. I must trust that others will have their own journeys through it. Some may realize how much they can do for themselves by not depending on me. Others may get angry and walk away. Then, there will be those who will be happy to see me make better choices for myself. No matter what the case, I need to do this for me. If I do it for anyone else, I will fail. This is my journey. I trust that whatever the result is with the people around me, it will be what is best for me. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ACTIVE VOICE</p><p></p><p>Active voice is a grammatical voice common in many of the world's languages. It is the unmarked voice for clauses featuring a transitive verb in nominative–accusative languages, including English and most other Indo-European languages.</p><p></p><p>PASSIVE VOICE</p><p></p><p>A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages. In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed. </p><br />
