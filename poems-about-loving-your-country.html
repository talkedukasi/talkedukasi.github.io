Amador T. Daguio
We voice no apologies.
We were caused by our time.
What we say happened to us.
Who have dared cold horizons.
So we say to you all:
We, too, have tasks to perform.
What if we are not of the privileged?
We love our country even much more
Perhaps than those who wallow in security.
If we denounce wrongs, know that
Our cry begs for our need?
We do not wreck; we wish to perform.
To plan proud blooms that will live-
Allow us then; give us your trust.

Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.
2
What means that noise, that bustle we hear?
Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.
3
There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!
8
My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well.

Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

We voice no apologies.
We were caused by our time.
What we say happened to us.
Who have dared cold horizons.
So we say to you all:
We, too, have tasks to perform.
What if we are not of the privileged?
We love our country even much more
Perhaps than those who wallow in security.
If we denounce wrongs, know that
Our cry begs for our need?
We do not wreck; we wish to perform.
To plan proud blooms that will live-
Allow us then; give us your trust.

1
Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.
2
What means that noise, that bustle we hear?
Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.
3
There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!
8
My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

                            16. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />
