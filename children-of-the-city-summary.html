Its goal is to explore and bring out the various emotions and insights of the participants to uas concepts in the findings of the study.The results of this study have shown that single parents of school children face a lot of variouadversities in life. Financial and emotional adversities in taking care and supporting the needs of their childreare common dilemmas they stand against. Few single parents can successfully raise children alone, despite thesocial expectation that noncustodial parents (usually the father) should only be responsible for supplementafinancial support, while the custodial parent (usually the mother) takes on both parenting and economic roles(Goldscheider and Waite 1991). The behavior of children may also be affected by the separation of parents. Infact, according to a study, many fathers stop seeing their children regularly after the firs year of divorce. Thiscan cause children to act out from the hurt and lack of a positive male role model. Behavioral problems can alsooccur when single moms are working too hard, making it more difficult to manage discipline effectively (Welton,2015).Recommendations 5: pa helps po. ipasa nmn buwas po please​</p>

Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</a>

                                            Summary "Grave of the Fireflies" The date is September 25th, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. A young boy sits against a pillar at Sannomiya Station, dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor removes his body and digs through his possessions, finding nothing but a candy tin containing ashes and a few fragments of bone which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin springs the spirit of the young boy followed by his little sister along with a cloud of fireflies. The spirit of the young boy, Selta (Tsutomu Tatsumi, English: J. Robert Spencer), narrates the story of how he and his sister, Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi, English: Rhoda Chrosite), fared in the wake of the firebombings of Kobe during the war. 14-year-old Selta and 4-year-old Setsuko live with their mother (Yoshiko Shinohara), English: Veronica Taylor) comfortably in Kobe while their father serves as a captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy. One day, air raid sirens go off as a fleet of American B-29 Superfortress bombers flies overhead. The children's mother, who suffers from a heart condition, puts Setsuko in the care of her older brother and instructs him to secure the home while she goes ahead to a bomb shelter. Hundreds of incendiary bombs are dropped on the city and most of the civilians are caught off-guard. Seita and Setsuko manage to survive the bombing unscathed and go in search of their mother. They find her at a makeshift clinic set up within a school, horribly burnt and covered head to foot with bloody bandages. She dies a short time later and is cremated in a mass grave with other casualties. Despite their loss, Seita is determined to care for Setsuko and protect her at all costs. They travel to the home of their aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi, English: Amy Jones) who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living there, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing and gives them all to his aunt, however, he keeps one tin of fruit drops for himself. The children's aunt becomes increasingly bitter due to the hardships brought on by the war. She becomes resentful of the children as food rations shrink and she accuses Seita on having done nothing to earn the food she cooks. Tired of his aunt's insults, Seita decides to leave with Setsuko and care for her on his own. They find refuge Inside an abandoned bomb shelter and release fireflies within for light. Come morning, Setsuko is horrified to find that all the fireflies have died. She creates a grave for them in the dirt and Seita realizes the depth of her understanding when she asks him why their mother had to die too. The children soon run out of rice and food and, unable to find work or other means, Seita is forced to steal from local farmers' homes during air raids. When he is caught, he comes to terms with his desperation and takes an increasingly ill Setsuko to a doctor.

They go to the place in the forest where the ng to find a pot of gold. Instead, they find a child wrapped in a gold cloak embroidered with stars and amber necklace Although he is very poor and already has several children of his own, one of the Woodcutters wearing decides to take the child home with him. He has difficulty persuading his wife to take in the child, but he tells her that the boy a Star-Child The Woodcutter and his wife treat the Star-Child as one of their own children for the next ten years The Star-Child grows up to be a handsome boy, but he is also very vain. As the son of a star, he believes himself to be superior to everyone else in the village. He cannot bear people from the lowest levels of society and throws stones at beggars whenever he sees them. He also tortures and kills small animals. A gang of similarly minded children gather around the Star-Child and accept him as their leader. One day, the Star-Child and his friends throw stones at an ugly beggar woman. The Woodcutter, who is nearby, chastises the Star-Child, saying that he cannot understand why the boy behaves that way, given that he treated the Star-Child kindly ever since he found him in the forest. At these words, the beggar woman faints. When the beggar woman comes around In the Woodcutter's house, she says that her child, who was wrapped in a gold cloak embroidered with stars and wearing an amber necklace, was stolen from her by robbers in the forest ten years ago, The Star-Child is told that the woman is his mother, but he wants nothing to do with her. When she asks for a kiss before she leaves, he says, "rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee" The Star-Child goes to rejoin his friends, but they shun him and call him ugly. He finds that he now has a face like a toad and skin like an adder. He realizes that he is being punished for his mistreatment of his mother, in the hope that he might regain his former appearance if his mother forgave him, he goes off in search of her. After three years, the Star-Child arrives at a city. The soldiers who guard the city gates sell him as a slave to a Magician. The Magician tells the Star-Child that in a forest near the city there are three pieces of gold. They are a piece of white gold, a piece of yellow gold, and a piece of red gold. He tells the Star-Child to fetch the piece of white gold the next day, telling him that he will be punished if he does not bring it back. The Star-Child spends all day looking for the piece of white gold but cannot find it. As he is about to leave the forest empty-handed, he notices a Hare which is caught in a trap and frees the animal. Out of gratitude, the Hare leads the boy to the piece of white gold. Outside the city gates, a leper begs a coin from the Star-Child. The boy gives him the piece of white gold. When he returns to the Magician's house empty-handed. he is beaten. The following day, the Star-Child is sent to find the piece of yellow gold, Again, the Hare leads the Star-Child to the golden piece, again he gives the piece of gold to the begging leper and the Magician gives him a worse beating when he returns empty-handed once more. The Magician tells the Star-Child that he will kill him if he does not return with the piece of red gold the following day. However, after having been led to it by the Hare, the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the leper, whom he believes needs it more than he does. As soon as the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the beggar, the same soldiers who had sold him into slavery call him their lord and compliment him on his good looks. When the Star-Child protests that he is ugly, one of the soldiers shows him his reflection in a shield. The boy finds that he has become handsome once again. A crowd of people proclaim the Star-Child to be the king who, according to a prophecy, was to come to them that day. The Star-Child says that he cannot became king until he has earned his mother's forgiveness. He sees the beggar woman seated next to the leper The Star-Child cries at the beggar woman's feet, washing them with his tears. As a result of the kindness the Star-Child has shown them, the beggar woman and the leper magically take on the appearance of a King and Queen. The leper a revealed to be the Star-Child's father. For a short while, the people of the city live happily under the rule of the Star-Child Unfortunately, he dies after three years and the cruel king succeeds him.​</a>

Its goal is to explore and bring out the various emotions and insights of the participants to uas concepts in the findings of the study.The results of this study have shown that single parents of school children face a lot of variouadversities in life. Financial and emotional adversities in taking care and supporting the needs of their childreare common dilemmas they stand against. Few single parents can successfully raise children alone, despite thesocial expectation that noncustodial parents (usually the father) should only be responsible for supplementafinancial support, while the custodial parent (usually the mother) takes on both parenting and economic roles(Goldscheider and Waite 1991). The behavior of children may also be affected by the separation of parents. Infact, according to a study, many fathers stop seeing their children regularly after the firs year of divorce. Thiscan cause children to act out from the hurt and lack of a positive male role model. Behavioral problems can alsooccur when single moms are working too hard, making it more difficult to manage discipline effectively (Welton,2015).Recommendations 5: pa helps po. ipasa nmn buwas po please​</h2><br />

                            2. Make a summary about the topic below and explain why it belongs to that type of qualitative research. 
Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teenage pregnancy, also known as adolescent pregnancy, is pregnancy in a female under the age of 20, according to the WHO. Pregnancy can occur with sexual intercourse after the start of ovulation, which can be before the first menstrual period (menarche) but usually occurs after the onset of periods. The main objective of the research was to explore how young women responded to finding out they were pregnant, who they talked to, who supported them, and how their behaviours were influenced by local services, including access to sex education and contraception advice.</p><br />

                            6. Summary "Grave of the Fireflies" The date is September 25th, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. A young boy sits against a pillar at Sannomiya Station, dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor removes his body and digs through his possessions, finding nothing but a candy tin containing ashes and a few fragments of bone which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin springs the spirit of the young boy followed by his little sister along with a cloud of fireflies. The spirit of the young boy, Selta (Tsutomu Tatsumi, English: J. Robert Spencer), narrates the story of how he and his sister, Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi, English: Rhoda Chrosite), fared in the wake of the firebombings of Kobe during the war. 14-year-old Selta and 4-year-old Setsuko live with their mother (Yoshiko Shinohara), English: Veronica Taylor) comfortably in Kobe while their father serves as a captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy. One day, air raid sirens go off as a fleet of American B-29 Superfortress bombers flies overhead. The children's mother, who suffers from a heart condition, puts Setsuko in the care of her older brother and instructs him to secure the home while she goes ahead to a bomb shelter. Hundreds of incendiary bombs are dropped on the city and most of the civilians are caught off-guard. Seita and Setsuko manage to survive the bombing unscathed and go in search of their mother. They find her at a makeshift clinic set up within a school, horribly burnt and covered head to foot with bloody bandages. She dies a short time later and is cremated in a mass grave with other casualties. Despite their loss, Seita is determined to care for Setsuko and protect her at all costs. They travel to the home of their aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi, English: Amy Jones) who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living there, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing and gives them all to his aunt, however, he keeps one tin of fruit drops for himself. The children's aunt becomes increasingly bitter due to the hardships brought on by the war. She becomes resentful of the children as food rations shrink and she accuses Seita on having done nothing to earn the food she cooks. Tired of his aunt's insults, Seita decides to leave with Setsuko and care for her on his own. They find refuge Inside an abandoned bomb shelter and release fireflies within for light. Come morning, Setsuko is horrified to find that all the fireflies have died. She creates a grave for them in the dirt and Seita realizes the depth of her understanding when she asks him why their mother had to die too. The children soon run out of rice and food and, unable to find work or other means, Seita is forced to steal from local farmers' homes during air raids. When he is caught, he comes to terms with his desperation and takes an increasingly ill Setsuko to a doctor. The doctor informs Seita that his sister is suffering from malnutrition but offers no help. Desperate, Seita withdraws all of the money remaining in his mother's bank account, hoping that it will be enough to treat Setsuko or buy food. As he leaves the bank he becomes distraught when he learns from a nearby crowd that Japan has surrendered to the Allied Forces. Not only that, but he finds that the ship his father captained has been sunk along with most of the Imperial Navy. His father, who had once promised him that Japan could never be defeated.​</h2><br />

One day, the Star-Child and his friends throw stones at an ugly beggar woman. The Woodcutter, who is nearby, chastises the Star-Child, saying that he cannot understand why the boy behaves that way, given that he treated the Star-Child kindly ever since he found him in the forest. At these words, the beggar woman faints. When the beggar woman comes around In the Woodcutter's house, she says that her child, who was wrapped in a gold cloak embroidered with stars and wearing an amber necklace, was stolen from her by robbers in the forest ten years ago, The Star-Child is told that the woman is his mother, but he wants nothing to do with her.

He tells the Star-Child to fetch the piece of white gold the next day, telling him that he will be punished if he does not bring it back.

As he is about to leave the forest empty-handed, he notices a Hare which is caught in a trap and frees the animal. Out of gratitude, the Hare leads the boy to the piece of white gold. Outside the city gates, a leper begs a coin from the Star-Child. The boy gives him the piece of white gold. When he returns to the Magician's house empty-handed. he is beaten. The following day, the Star-Child is sent to find the piece of yellow gold, Again, the Hare leads the Star-Child to the golden piece, again he gives the piece of gold to the begging leper and the Magician gives him a worse beating when he returns empty-handed once more.

However, after having been led to it by the Hare, the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the leper, whom he believes needs it more than he does. As soon as the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the beggar, the same soldiers who had sold him into slavery call him their lord and compliment him on his good looks. When the Star-Child protests that he is ugly, one of the soldiers shows him his reflection in a shield. The boy finds that he has become handsome once again.
