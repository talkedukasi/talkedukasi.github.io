                                            Are you a person who graduated with honors yet cannot keep or advance in a job? Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them.</a>

Emotional Intelligence  Are you a person who graduated with honors yet cannot keep or advance in a job? Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them. </a>

                            3. Are you a person who graduated with honors yet cannot keep or advance in a job? Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them.</h2><br />

Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them. </h2><br />

It is not the sole responsibility of the government to stop the global pandemic, and it is imperative for people to join in the efforts and collectively stop the virus from further infecting anyone. This rings true in the Philippines, where the spirit of bayanihan is slowly being revived amid the onslaught of natural and man-made catastrophes that struck the whole country during the first three months of 2020.
