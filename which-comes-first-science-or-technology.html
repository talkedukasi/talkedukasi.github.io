                                            Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

                                            For both films, I will only focus on a few values that are most present. The first series we’ll explore is Spider-Man. The first Spider-
Man movie came out in 2002 and is ranked seventh of all time US box office grossing films. The second movie is ranked 10th and
the third movie is currently ranked 92nd although this movie can move up as it is still in theaters. Spider-Man is one helpful dude,
no argument there. He does everything from Thor crimes to rescue people from burning buildings. Now, that’s helpfulness. Even
though saving the city from various deranged supervillains is a time-consuming activity, Peter Parker in line with Williams’ site of
US values is still seeking employment. He is not the only one either. His Uncle Ben having been let go from a previous job is
attempting to find another one. In this scene, Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker discuss work as Mary Jane is on her way to
an audition and she had previously got off of work. Science and technology is everywhere in Spider-Man so without further
ado, here are a few examples:
A. Oscorp in their weapons and human performing enhancers which Norman ends up using to cause all sorts of trouble
B. The genetic engineering lab where Peter Parker is bit by a radioactive spider changing his DNA giving him the abilities he
uses as Spider-man
C. Dr. Octavius in his fusion reactor and of course the infamous mechanical arms
D. The particle physics facility that brings about sandman and Harry Osborne’s resurrection of all his father’s gadgets and gizmos
that he uses to knock the snot out of Peter Parker
The second and final story we will be looking at is Harry Potter. Education is clearly seen in these films as the main setting is
the school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts. When looking at efficiency, there is nothing more efficient than magic. You
say it and it happens. It’s that simple. The value of achievement and success has a large presence in the Harry Potter story. For
example, the competition between the four houses within the school, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw is entirely
about outdoing others. Harry Potter consistently outdoes others. He has praised for his achievements such as his skill in the wizard
game of quidditch. In this scene, we see Harry being applauded for his completion of the latest Triwizard tournament stage.
Harry Potter, even with his success, does face the small problem of attempts on his life. As a baby, Harry Potter brings down the
leader of a wizard superiority group when the leader’s spell meant to kill Harry backfires.
Harry runs into the same group superiority value almost immediately when he enters Hogwarts. In this scene from the fourth
movie, we see the wizard superiority group named the death eaters assemble. Their leader is now back in power after previously
being crippled during the encounter with Harry as a baby. This plot will continue in the next movie which has yet to be released.
As you have seen, Robin Williams’ American values with Jane Henslin’s traditions are quite present in top US grossing films. Some
of these values may lose their importance as our society changes. Williams already believes activity at work is becoming less
important. Other values may even come into being. But what makes these social values and films popular for such a broad
audience? Can we conclude that these values are what makes the films popular or is it the films themselves that make these
social values? - Edworks Production

                                            First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, not the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves. The second point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history. Third, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern and industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows. And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces — that is to say, technologically.​</a>

                                            3. Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.</a>

                            7. Unit 1. SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on.

                            10. For both films, I will only focus on a few values that are most present. The first series we’ll explore is Spider-Man. The first Spider-
Man movie came out in 2002 and is ranked seventh of all time US box office grossing films. The second movie is ranked 10th and
the third movie is currently ranked 92nd although this movie can move up as it is still in theaters. Spider-Man is one helpful dude,
no argument there. He does everything from Thor crimes to rescue people from burning buildings. Now, that’s helpfulness. Even
though saving the city from various deranged supervillains is a time-consuming activity, Peter Parker in line with Williams’ site of
US values is still seeking employment. He is not the only one either. His Uncle Ben having been let go from a previous job is
attempting to find another one. In this scene, Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker discuss work as Mary Jane is on her way to
an audition and she had previously got off of work. Science and technology is everywhere in Spider-Man so without further
ado, here are a few examples:
A. Oscorp in their weapons and human performing enhancers which Norman ends up using to cause all sorts of trouble
B. The genetic engineering lab where Peter Parker is bit by a radioactive spider changing his DNA giving him the abilities he
uses as Spider-man
C. Dr. Octavius in his fusion reactor and of course the infamous mechanical arms
D. The particle physics facility that brings about sandman and Harry Osborne’s resurrection of all his father’s gadgets and gizmos
that he uses to knock the snot out of Peter Parker
The second and final story we will be looking at is Harry Potter. Education is clearly seen in these films as the main setting is
the school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts. When looking at efficiency, there is nothing more efficient than magic. You
say it and it happens. It’s that simple. The value of achievement and success has a large presence in the Harry Potter story. For
example, the competition between the four houses within the school, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw is entirely
about outdoing others. Harry Potter consistently outdoes others. He has praised for his achievements such as his skill in the wizard
game of quidditch. In this scene, we see Harry being applauded for his completion of the latest Triwizard tournament stage.
Harry Potter, even with his success, does face the small problem of attempts on his life. As a baby, Harry Potter brings down the
leader of a wizard superiority group when the leader’s spell meant to kill Harry backfires.
Harry runs into the same group superiority value almost immediately when he enters Hogwarts. In this scene from the fourth
movie, we see the wizard superiority group named the death eaters assemble. Their leader is now back in power after previously
being crippled during the encounter with Harry as a baby. This plot will continue in the next movie which has yet to be released.
As you have seen, Robin Williams’ American values with Jane Henslin’s traditions are quite present in top US grossing films. Some
of these values may lose their importance as our society changes. Williams already believes activity at work is becoming less
important. Other values may even come into being. But what makes these social values and films popular for such a broad
audience? Can we conclude that these values are what makes the films popular or is it the films themselves that make these
social values? - Edworks Production

                        Science comes first because in ancient times some people already knew science like Louis Pasteur who teaches us some informations about bacteria such and many more but it is not part of technology and before a person know technology they must know science first to know the right handling and caution d and many more... for short Science comes first!<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p>Science because it deals with the study and creating new object while technology is there process</p><br />

                            19. First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, not the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves. The second point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history. Third, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern and industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows. And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces — that is to say, technologically.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Science and Technology</p><p>Science informs technological advancements. We rely on theories on physics, material science, electricity, chemistry, etc to develop new technologies. Indeed, we’re still working to create a lot of potentially useful materials that are predicted to exist, based on our current scientific theories, and the more scientific theory develops, the more it can inform our technological advancements. Our ability to create such powerful computers is informed by our science. Quantum computers are being developed, based on our science on the topic, which will further our computing power by orders of magnitude.</p><p></p><p>But technology also changes how we do science. Think about the invention of the telescope. It vastly changed our ability to conduct astronomical research. Space telescopes, probes like Voyager, the Cassini probe and the Huygens lander, etc have done even more. Even more recently, technological advancements have allowed us to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth, which has allowed us to actually photograph a black hole (or really the material around it).</p><p></p><p>I happened to pick astronomy as an example, but the influence technology has had on science is — well — astronomical. Computing power, storage capacity, and so on has allowed for data science and the use of big data in medical sciences, sociology, economics, and more. So the very computers that are being developed, using scientific theory and evidence, also help us do scientific research.</p><p></p><p>Technology and Society</p><p>In some ways, the influence that technology has had on society is obvious. It’s also very profound. Just consider your ability to ask the Quora community this question, and our ability to answer. It would not exist without technology. Social media, the internet as a whole, blockchain technology, etc all have had significant influences on society.</p><p></p><p>Of course earlier technological revolutions such as the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution cannot be ignored either. The ability to create materials that we use in our everyday life, the ability to feed a massive amount of people, and so on, are all thanks to the development of technological innovations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while technology has been a great boon for prosperity, it has also had some negative impacts. It has produced quite a bit of pollution, though hopefully technology and science will cure that issue. Probably the worst use of technology — and the science which informs its development — has been weapons of mass destruction.</p><p></p><p>In the opposite direction, society drives technology and sometimes prohibits its development. I recently finished a piece on the ethics of fiction writing, in which I touched on the importance that fiction has had on inspiring new technology and warning of threats that we could face in the future[1]. Society also drives technological evolution through need. Very often a technology emerges because someone recognizes a need for that technology.</p><p></p><p>Science and Society</p><p>Just as technology often develops because there is a need for it, science helps solve the needs of society. While a major goal of science is to simply better our understanding, many people leverage science to help solve real world problems in society.</p><p></p><p>The need for a better understanding of epidemics, for instance, drives our research of the topic. Science also improves our understanding of society. Anthropology, sociology, economics, political science, and so on, all help us better understand how society functions. Additionally, like with technology, society can influence our theories, and their evolution. A desire to travel through time, or faster than the speed of light is more than enough to spur on the development of theories that, if correct, would allow such things.</p><p></p><p>Finally, because science alters our understanding of the world, it has had a significant impact on our belief systems, our norms, and our values, as well as our daily behaviors. Germ theory, for instance, has changed our sanitation habits and our hygiene, as well as our food safety protocols. Hand washing is an essential habit that we have primarily because of our understanding of how pathogens spread. And it’s just one of many ways in which scientific theory and evidence has changed our behavior.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Baka po sabihin nyo mahaba.</strong></p><p><strong>Sana ito po yung tamang sagot.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. 3. Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.</h2><br />
