                                            9. Many of the great civilizations in the history have sprung along rivers and deltas. This is true with many places in the Philippines like Cagayan de Oro and Butuan. Here are some observations and statements about these places.Agriculture and aquaculture are mostly the livelihood of people living along rivers and deltas.• "Seasonal floods bring fortune to the community alongside rivers" Which can be the best inference we can derive from these observations?A. A river system with water all year-round acts as cooling agents for crops alongside the rivers and water organisms to grow well.B. Where there is water, plants and animals will surely be thriving healthily. C. River systems and deltas are but waterways for easier transport of agricultural goods. Fish areD. Riverbanks and deltas are fertile land with rich nutrients supplied by occasional flooding.​</a>

Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic.

The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail.

At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</a>

It was first mentioned in the 164 century in the Chronicles of Pigafetta, and is gown as the oldest Pre-hispanic watercraft found in the PhilippinesArcheologists found parts of the balangay in Butuan City in 1976.These artfacts are dated from anywhere between 320-1250 CE. They areestimated to measure 15 meters long and 3-4 meters wide, propelled by sailof buri or nipa fiber or padding, and holds 60 to 90 people. It was used to cargoand rading purposes, serving as evidence that Butuan played a central role in trade.The finely built boat constructed without the use of blueprints was taughtfrom one generation to another. This technique is still used by boat makers ofSibutu IslandVintaThis boat is traditionally made by the Badjaos who live in the Sulu archipelago.The sail, called vinta, consists of several colors and geometric shapes, representing thecolorful culture and history of the Muslim people. These boats are small and not meantto be used for long ocean travel. They are used for livelihood activities such as fishingand diving for pearts and transportation around the archipelago.1.Learning Taak 1: Think Back and Enumerate: Enumerate the differences and similarities of balanghay and vinta.(Coryen anthis activity to your Answer sheet or intermediate pad).BALANGHAYVINTA​</a>

Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose.​</a>

                            5. 9. Many of the great civilizations in the history have sprung along rivers and deltas. This is true with many places in the Philippines like Cagayan de Oro and Butuan. Here are some observations and statements about these places.Agriculture and aquaculture are mostly the livelihood of people living along rivers and deltas.• "Seasonal floods bring fortune to the community alongside rivers" Which can be the best inference we can derive from these observations?A. A river system with water all year-round acts as cooling agents for crops alongside the rivers and water organisms to grow well.B. Where there is water, plants and animals will surely be thriving healthily. C. River systems and deltas are but waterways for easier transport of agricultural goods. Fish areD.

This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</h2><br />

They areestimated to measure 15 meters long and 3-4 meters wide, propelled by sailof buri or nipa fiber or padding, and holds 60 to 90 people. It was used to cargoand rading purposes, serving as evidence that Butuan played a central role in trade.The finely built boat constructed without the use of blueprints was taughtfrom one generation to another. This technique is still used by boat makers ofSibutu IslandVintaThis boat is traditionally made by the Badjaos who live in the Sulu archipelago.The sail, called vinta, consists of several colors and geometric shapes, representing thecolorful culture and history of the Muslim people.
