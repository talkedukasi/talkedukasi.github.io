KEY TERMS
YOUR VOICE, or your own perspective of the world, can affect the way you create your character’s world. The invitation is to make strange that which is familiar and make familiar that which is exotic. 
DETAIL adds to the meaning of your work. Know your setting fully, experience it mentally, and create it through significant detail. Every detail in your setting supports and impinges on your characters.
CONTEXT includes the societal norms and traditions of a particular period, its heritage and culture, its socio-political milieu. Setting is not just the background, but is part and parcel of what is significant, what creates meaning in your work. 
MOOD is a state of mind or emotion. Our response to place, time, weather, and the things around us is always charged with subtle or profound emotion, mellow or harsh judgment.
SYMBOL is the eternal manifestation of the inner, the concrete expressing the abstract, the contingent standing for the essential. Setting may hinge on the externals, but a writer is always conscious that material things reflect far more than what is seen. 
ACTION is the dynamic relationship between the character and the setting. If setting is the background, then there may be harmony or conflict between the character and the setting. Your characters may be comfortably at ease in the world around them, or they may be uneasy or uncomfortable, full of foreboding.</a>

help pls need now</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is about a woman named Soledad who is married to a man named Pedro Buhay. They live on a farm. One morning Soledad finds herself knowing that the farm will produce plenty but that she still had some inner feeling of discontent. She planned to mend some of her husband's shirts, which were in a locked trunk. Pedro took out from his pocket a string which held two keys, one large and shiny and one small and rusty. He gave Soledad the large key to his trunk and put the small key back in his jacket pocket. Since it was hot that morning, he removed his coat before leaving to work in the field. When he was gone, Soledad began to fold the jacket and the small key fell to the floor. It is obvious that Pedro values the small key while Soledad fears it.</p><p></p><p>Soledad knows that the small key is a key to a different trunk. She tries to busy herself so that she will not think about what the smaller trunk contains, but she cannot stop thinking about it and reveals that the small trunk contains clothing that belonged to Pedro's first wife. She wonders why it is that he keeps her old clothing and why he seems to have a special feeling about them. She obviously fears that Pedro still loves his first wife even though she has been dead for many years by now. She reveals that she hates the things in the small trunk and worries that they will destroy the relationship between her and her husband. Despite her attempts to not think about the contents of the small trunk, Soledad opens it. At this point, Pedro returns home to find Soledad in bed supposedly with a fever. It turns out she does not. The next morning Pedro discovers a pile of ashes and half burnt clothing in the backyard. He realizes what Soledad has done and rushes to look in the trunk to confirm it. Soledad has indeed, burned his first wife's clothing.</p><p></p><p>Pedro is angry and bitter that this has happened and he expects that Soleda will explain things later. He thinks to himself that he will forgive her because he loves her but that even if she did it out of love for him, it will always remain a matter of some resentment toward her for doing it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope is helps</p><br />

In ancient times, the abacus was used as a calculator; it aided in performing mathematical processes like counting, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.<strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> (CPU) . The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results. The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it.In computing, an <strong>input device</strong> is a peripheral (piece of computer hardware equipment) used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or other information appliance.

KEY TERMS
YOUR VOICE, or your own perspective of the world, can affect the way you create your character’s world. The invitation is to make strange that which is familiar and make familiar that which is exotic. 
DETAIL adds to the meaning of your work. Know your setting fully, experience it mentally, and create it through significant detail. Every detail in your setting supports and impinges on your characters.
CONTEXT includes the societal norms and traditions of a particular period, its heritage and culture, its socio-political milieu. Setting is not just the background, but is part and parcel of what is significant, what creates meaning in your work. 
MOOD is a state of mind or emotion. Our response to place, time, weather, and the things around us is always charged with subtle or profound emotion, mellow or harsh judgment.
SYMBOL is the eternal manifestation of the inner, the concrete expressing the abstract, the contingent standing for the essential. Setting may hinge on the externals, but a writer is always conscious that material things reflect far more than what is seen. 
ACTION is the dynamic relationship between the character and the setting. If setting is the background, then there may be harmony or conflict between the character and the setting. Your characters may be comfortably at ease in the world around them, or they may be uneasy or uncomfortable, full of foreboding.</h2><br />
