                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the importance of knowing media and information sources is that once you know the sources, you can easily be directed to what and where you should look for information according to the type of scenario or situation you are interested for instance, you want to keep track of an incoming typhoon, you have to look for media sources like weather station sites or if you want to be updated with the happenings in the sea games or other upcoming and ongoing events, you have to search for it in recreational or sports sites and if you also want to be updated regarding you favourite tv personalities or celebrities, you can log in to social sites that focuses on celebrities and social personnels.</p><p></p><p>media languages of a film affect the understanding of the film in terms of the people's perspectives and opinion regarding a certain film, the values and morals of a film, the topic and theme and how basically how the plot of the film goes. Basically, language had been a great help in understanding a lot of things but it could also be a great barrier to other aspects such as cultural aspects wherein korean language is used in korean dramas, and other languages  which are used in a certain locality but differ from the languages of the international viewers around the world. Language became mainly a barrier that affects the understanding because if the fact that not all people can speak and understand many languages which leads to confusion, misconception, misunderstanding, and misinterpretation of a certain film or say a movie. And to aid this kind of problem, the film should provide subtitles or interpretations about the film in order for international or other viewers to understand what the film is all about.</p><br />
