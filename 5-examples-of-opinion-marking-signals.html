                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Bullying shouldn't be justified even if it's inside or outside of school. Teachers shouldn't ignore the situation their pupils are in because it would damage them and would effect their classes. </p><p></p><p>2. I get that school needs money, but sometimes it's just overpriced. Sometimes the money that the student gives isn't even for the essential things. Students should have a reasonable paycheck and teachers should have a reasonable payment </p><p></p><p>3. Depending on the food and how much effort and quality it has, high prices is fine. But if everything turns to be expensive then that would be the problem. High prices should be on high quality foods. But being reasonable with it is the best way to solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>4. Corruption is already bad itself government corruption is even worse. Governments should not be egoistical and be humble. Since they're the examples of that place, and should act like it. There grown ups and need to understand that they're leaders that should be mature. </p><p></p><p>5. Sometimes they could be right. But if it's tested and properly researched, it's best to give it out for the people's protection. If the vaccines are legitimate than simply allow it as long as there's no complications </p><br />
