                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think that the criticism of Benjamin Franklin is unfair. His plan for moral perfection was designed to help people achieve their highest potential, both in terms of their character and their material circumstances. He sought to create a system of principles that would help guide people's behavior in order to bring out their best. While it may be regimented and superficial to some, I believe it is a valid approach to personal development and growth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Marxist criticism is not merely a 'sociology of literature', concerned with how novels get published and whether they mention the working class. Its aim is to explain the literary work more fully; and this means a sensitive attention to its forms, styles and, meanings.</p><p>2.Structuralist critics analyzed material by examining underlying structures, such as characterization or plot, and attempted to show how these patterns were universal and could thus be used to develop general conclusions about both individual works and the systems from which they emerged.</p><p>3.Moral criticism is also concerned with the 'seriousness' of a work and whether its purpose is worthy of its means—it is from this perspective than one speaks of such things as 'gratuitous' sex in a novel, or nudity in a film, when it isn't seen to serve the moral purpose of the narrative</p><br />
