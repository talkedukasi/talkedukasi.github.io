Why not?kwento:A mouse told his mother and father that he was going on a trip to the seashore.“We are very alarmed!” they cried. “The world is full of terrors. You must not go!”“I have made my decision,” said the Mouse firmly. “I have never seen the ocean, and it’s high time that I did. Nothing can make me change my mind.”“Then we cannot stop you,” said the Mother and Father Mouse, “but do be careful!”The next day, in the first light of dawn, the Mouse began his journey. Even before the morning had ended, the Mouse came to know trouble and fear.A Cat jumped out from behind a tree.“I will eat you for lunch,” he said.It was a narrow escape for the Mouse. He ran for his life, but he left a part of his tail in the mouth of the Cat.By afternoon the Mouse had been attacked by birds and dogs. He had lost his way several times. He was bruised and bloodied. He was tired and frightened.At evening the Mouse slowly climbed the last hill and saw the seashore spreading out before him. He watched the waves rolling onto the beach, one after another. All the colors of the sunset filled the sky. “How beautiful!” cried the Mouse. “I wish that Mother and Father were here to see this with me.”The moon and the stars began to appear over the ocean. The Mouse sat silently on the top of the hill. He was overwhelmed by a feeling of deep peace and contentment. ​</a>
