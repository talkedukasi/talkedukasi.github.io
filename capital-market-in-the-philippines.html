                                            The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</a>

                                            a The Philippines is known as the festive capital of the world. Every place in the country has a festival of its own. As such, every 30th of April, Lopezenos celebrates the "Pamaypayan Festival" as its annual festival celebrating its good harvest and a year full of blessings. It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</a>

                                            Directions: Given research titles and their abstracts below and explain the importance of conducting the study to the different stakeholders. I WANT TO BE TALL SOMEDAY: Height Aspirations Among Young People in the Philippines When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve in the Philippines, many children jump as high as they can, believing (with their parents) that it would make them grow taller. In my ethnography, I found many other practices that are believed to boost children's statures when they grow -up, from sleeping in the afternoon to taking popular growth supplements that are overtly marketed with claims that it can make children grow tall. HATCHE What aspirations are embedded in the desire for tallness that informs these practices? I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices. Moreover, the desire for tallness can be read as an idiom for young people's desire for better lives. Guide Questions: 1. What is the significance of the study to the following?

                            8. The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</h2><br />

As such, every 30th of April, Lopezenos celebrates the "Pamaypayan Festival" as its annual festival celebrating its good harvest and a year full of blessings. It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</h2><br />

                            19. ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</h2><br />

                            25. Directions: Given research titles and their abstracts below and explain the importance of conducting the study to the different stakeholders. I WANT TO BE TALL SOMEDAY: Height Aspirations Among Young People in the Philippines When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve in the Philippines, many children jump as high as they can, believing (with their parents) that it would make them grow taller. In my ethnography, I found many other practices that are believed to boost children's statures when they grow -up, from sleeping in the afternoon to taking popular growth supplements that are overtly marketed with claims that it can make children grow tall. HATCHE What aspirations are embedded in the desire for tallness that informs these practices? I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices.
