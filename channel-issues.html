                                            In many ways, quarantine checkpoints are a lot like our cell membrane in
carefully allowing some things to enter (such as food delivery, health products) and
keep others out (people from other cities, individuals with symptoms). Medical
personnel, PNPs can pass through quickly via special channel while regular
individuals pass through more slowly. Because of these gated channels, the selective
permeability of the membrane will be ensured. How would you address the issue of waste disposal to the community?</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many artists approach social issues, the environment, and/or politics not only as themes to explore but also areas to effect change, which has implications for the role of the artist in society</p><p></p><p><strong>ARTIST:</strong></p><p>Raul Gonzalez, visual artist
</p><p>When I first came to the Boston area twelve years ago I immediately began to search for places where I felt I could participate. I found friends working in music, comic books, gallery artists, art directors, writers, future curators, basically young kids who in time began to make strides in the area. I worked as an artist who would draw fliers, illustrate books, participate in coffee shop shows and eventually this somehow lead to gallery and museum exhibitions. Participation in the social lead to so many opportunities that I never thought I would or could be a part of.
</p><p>
</p><p>My work is a reflection of the world that I actively participate in, whether it’s something close to home or news and events from afar. The series “Lookum Here: it might could have been” simultaneously reflected on the dehumanization of Native Americans and the dehumanized detainees of Guantanamo using symbols both old and new. Most recently my work has reflected circumstances of the border towns I grew up in.
</p><p>
</p><p>The environment is always present in my work, hot sun bleaching away the colors of the piece itself or threatening the lives of the characters as they bake under it desperately searching for salvation. These are ofttimes created under layers of clothing from my vitamin d deprived body in near isolation while most everyone is in deep slumber, and the funny part is you can make it all up and it becomes true anyway.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The report discusses the ways in which media and culture intersect, and how this intersection influences the information that is presented to the public.</p><p></p><p>In point 4, the report asserts that the media is a reflection of cultural values and priorities. This means that the types of information that are presented in the media are often determined by what the general public deems to be important or interesting. This can lead to a narrow range of perspectives being represented in media coverage, as certain topics or viewpoints may not align with predominant cultural values.</p><p></p><p>Point 5 emphasizes the importance of being aware of the context in which information is presented. The first media source to report on a particular issue is often able to set the tone and parameters of the discussion surrounding that topic. This can have a significant impact on public perception of the issue, as subsequent coverage is often framed within the context established by the initial media source.</p><p></p><p>Finally, point 6 highlights the importance of being critical consumers of media. The report suggests that media consumption is analogous to dietary habits, in that the information we consume has a direct impact on our cognitive health. It is therefore important to seek out a diverse range of perspectives and to avoid drawing conclusions based on limited or biased information.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of being aware of how media and culture interact, and of taking an active and critical approach to media consumption.</p><br />
