                                            PART 3 Directions: The following statements are all directly taken from the article written by Atty. Josephus B. Jimenez entitled "Is Bonifacio a better hero than Jose Rizal?" and from the essay written by Arlene C. Padilla entitled "To be Both Safe and Educated". Analyze each of them and identify whether they show comparison or contrast, then encircle the transitional devices used. Example: Contrast_a. Nevertheless, the different learning modalities are and can be made available in our homes, making distance leaming more accessible than the traditional one. 1. Rizal was essentially a peaceful reformist while Bonifacio was a passionate warrior and revolutionary. 2. Bonifacio was like Rizal's characterization of Elias, the filibuster and rebel, and who did not believe that the oppressors would ever accept peaceful reforms. 3. In contrast, Rizal was the mother's spoiled favorite son, adored by his many sisters, and served by his father and elder brother Paciano, who opted to work as farmer to support Rizal's vast travels to Europe. 4. Classrooms nowadays, both in public and private Educational institutions, have computer laboratories for learning. 5. Some schools have television and speakers in most of their classrooms. Radios are available but not as common and useful as the television and speaker.​</a>

Rizal was born in Calamba (now a city) in Laguna on June 19, 1861.  </strong></p><p><strong>A scion of a landed family, he understood large-scale farming, and such background came in handy when he was exiled in Dapitan.  </strong></p><p><strong>During the early part of his exile, Rizal acquired land from the Spanish government for his farm activities. Not satisfied with his small farm, he bought 16 hectares more of neglected land from various owners.  
</strong></p><p><strong>In just half a year, he had planted 5,000 pineapples and 1,400 coffee and 200 cacao trees on his land. Later, he purchased more land, which he planted with corn and abaca. Rizal dreamed of establishing an agricultural colony in the Sitio of Ponot near Sindangan Bay. It was ideal for cultivation of coffee, cacao and sugar canes because of its fertile soil and favorite climate. However, it was an unsuccessful plan as he was not supported by the Spanish government. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING </strong></p><p>
