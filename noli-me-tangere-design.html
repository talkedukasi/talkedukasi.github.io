                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Through 'Noli Me Tangere,' the American audience will see the strong influence of Spain on Philippine culture, social and moral values because the Philippines is the only country in Asia that has Spanish reputation. People say that 'Filipinos lived in a convent--during the Spanish occupation--for four centuries, and lived in Hollywood--during the American occupation--for 40 years'," explained Sibal, who was raised in Binondo, Manila, where the novel made into opera is set.</p><p></p><p>The musical presentation, an opera in Three Acts, follows the story of Juan Crisostomo Ibarra who returns to the Philippines after pursuing scholarly studies in Europe. He plans to open up a school and marry Maria Clara, his betrothed. However, parish priest Padre Damaso, the archenemy of the Ibarras, is out to hinder Crisostomo's plans, which creates "a dramatic storyline of forbidden love, betrayal and revenge."</p><p></p><p>"Noli Me Tangere" stars world renowned Filipino opera singers Sal Malaki (Juan Crisostomo Ibarra), Antoni Mendezona (Maria Clara), Andrew Fernando (Padre Damaso), Robert Perlas Gomez (Elias) and Maria Christina Navarro (Sisa), and young singer Kirby Asunto (Basilio).</p><p></p><p>The opera will be using its original lyrics in Tagalog, the first language of most Filipinos. However, supertitles will be provided for American audience members to understand the lyrics and the story.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>^v^ i hope it helps ^v^</p><p></p><br />

                            3. Symbolism in the Cover design of Rizal's Noli me Tangere?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Symbolism in the Cover design of Rizal's Noli Me Tangere</strong><strong>A Filipina silhouette: </strong>Possibly Maria Clara or the "Inang Bayan" to whom Rizal dictates the novel.<strong>Cross/Crucifix:</strong> Symbolizes the Catholic faith as it ascends above Inang Bayan and Filipinos (shows dominance). It also represents pain and death.<strong>Laurel Leaves &amp; Pomelo Blossoms: </strong>They represent faith, honor, and fidelity, which are the values Rizal wishes Filipinos to embody. Pomelos are commonly used to scent the air during prayers and cleansing rituals. Laurel leaves are used as crowns during the Greek Olympics to honor the best athletes.<strong>Torch on Fire:</strong> It is a reference to the Olympic torch. It is concerned with the awakening of Filipino consciousness. It also sheds light on the manuscript's text.<strong>Sunflower:</strong> It represents a new beginning.
