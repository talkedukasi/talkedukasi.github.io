                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p>Procedures:1. Make up the bed - make the bed upMake the bed. The first step in making your bed, whether it's after you wake up in the morning or after you've washed your linens, is to clear the bed. Remove all pillows, plush animals, comforters, and other items.Place the fitted sheet on top of the mattress. You'll need to put the fitted sheet on the bed if it isn't already there. Tuck the elasticized ends of the sheet around the mattress's corners to do this.Place the top sheet on top of the bottom sheet. Take the top sheet and place it on top of the bottom sheet. Remember to place the side with the large hem at the top of the bed, with the hem aligned with the mattress's head.Make a corner for the hospital. The term "hospital corner" refers to a particular manner of tucking the top sheet's end under the mattress. It's the trickiest aspect of making a bed, but it's also the one that makes it look the best.On top of that, place the duvet or comforter. After you've tucked the top sheets in, you may add your blankets, duvet, or comforter on top.Fold the top sheet and place the duvet on top. Fold the top sheet at the head of the bed over the top edge of the duvet, blanket, or comforter in a nice manner.Pillows should be fluffed. Grab your pillows and fluff them up before placing them on the bed. To fluff a pillow, hold it on both sides and squeeze the sides together before releasing - similar to accordion playing.Put the finishing touches on the project. Your bed is almost finished! To conclude, lean against the sleeping pillows for support and lay any ornamental cushions or pillows you may have in an upright posture at the top of the bed.<p></p>2. clean vacuum the floor-  vacuum clean the floorTake it slowly. Going gradually is the key to getting the cleanest clean. Begin at the far edge of your carpet or rug and go forward in a straight line with the vacuum.Clean in two directions. Another way to get your carpet particularly clean is to vacuum it not only up and down in rows, but also 90 degrees and side-to-side.Make Your Machine Clean. Yes, you do need to clean your vacuum. Cleaning the brushes and bristles will assist them to sweep up every last crumb on your carpet, and emptying the canister on a regular basis will enhance the suction.<p></p>3. Make up the bathroom​  Remove all of the things from their normal locations. Instead of doing this step as you go, do it throughout the entire bathroom for the best effects.Dust and sweep. To eliminate dust, use a long-handled duster to remove cobwebs from corners, light fixtures, and vents. If you're still having trouble reaching the cobwebs, bring in a stepladder.If you clean your shower on a regular basis, use an all-purpose cleaner; if you have a lot of buildups, use an acid-based cleaner.Make a floor cleaning solution. Fill a bucket halfway with warm water and the amount of all-purpose cleaner indicated on the package.Take a shower and soak in the tub. The cleaner will have done most of the work by this point, allowing you to lightly scrape away any remaining filth and debris.Complete the shower and bath. Replace all of the objects you took out, wiping them down as needed, and then close the shower curtain or door.Make sure the vanity area is clean. Spray the sink, faucets, and counters with the all-purpose cleaner, then wipe with a clean towel.Wipe down any towel racks, shelves, baseboards, doors, blinds, and windowsills with the all-purpose cleaner sprayed on your cleaning equipment (i.e. microfiber cloth, sponge, etc.).Make sure the toilet is clean. If you scrub the inside of your toilet on a regular basis, the all-purpose cleaner should suffice.Clean the floor. Clean the bathroom floor by dipping your mop into the cleaning solution, squeezing out the excess water, and then wiping it down. Replace the trashcan and your freshly cleaned rugs once they've dried.<p></p><p>To know more about the importance of following procedures, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13073306</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17615263</p><p>Hope this helps! :)
