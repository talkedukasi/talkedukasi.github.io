Based from the given selection,Write down and analyze the musical elements and characteristics ofIslamic music, vocal music and also include the mentioned traditional instruments and theiruses. Write your answers on the given spaces.The inusical practices of Mindanao reflect separate Islamic and non-Islamic culturaltraditions. When we talk about music, Mindanao music is characterized by a highly subtleorganization of melody and rhythm. is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over asubordinate chordal accompaniment, but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especiallylater in the period. Melisma singing, song phrases, narrow singing, fluid singing, tremolo,strained voice, nasal enunciation, these are some of the characteristics of Islamic music.We have the chants and lullabies under vocal music; the richness of his/her kulintangand bamboo ensemble, the popular solo instruments like the kudyapi, all of which are stronglyinfluenced by Islam and its traditions. Then we have the traditions of the Christians, whichnow has a very wide range of ancient and modern Catholic church music, and those non-Christians / non-Muslim's groups, the Lumad's folk songs.1.

                                            “The King and the Singing Bird”
Once upon a time, there was a bird
that had a beautiful voice. The bird
lived at the top of the tallest tree in
the forest. Every morning, the bird
sang so beautifully that all the animals
in the forest felt glad to be alive.
One day, the bird far-away sang so
loudly and happily that the king in his
castle heard the beautiful melody. “I
want that bird,” shouted the king,
who was used to getting his own way.
Hunters brought the bird in a cage to
the king.
“Sing for me,” announced the king.
The bird refused.
“Then I’ll eat you for dinner,” said
the king.
The cook was afraid but the bird
told her not to worry. “Even a king
cannot destroy a beautiful idea,” the
bird said.The cook gently stroked the bird
before putting it into the pot. At
dinner, the king ate the bird. The king
started to swell up. He got the
wickedness of his life poured out to
him from all over the land.
Then, the people in the kingdom
heard a song more beautifully than
any they have ever heard before.

Moral lesson     "THE KING AND THE SINGING BIRD" Once upon a time, there was a bird that had a beautiful voice. The bird lived at the top of the tallest tree in the forest. Every morning, the bird sang so beautifully that all the animals in the forest felt glad to be alive. One day, the bird far-away sang so loudly and happily that the king in his castle heard the beautiful melody. "I want that bird," shouted the king, who was used to getting his own way. Hunters brought the bird in a cage to the king. "Sing for me," announced the king. The bird refused. “Then I'll eat you for dinner," said the king The cook was afraid but the bird told her not to worry. "Even a king cannot destroy a beautiful idea," the bird saidThe cook gently stroked the bird before putting it into the pot. At dinner, the king ate the bird. The king started to swell up. He got the wickedness of his life poured out to him from all over the land. Then, the people in the kingdom heard a song more beautifully than any they have ever heard before.​</a>

                            13. “The King and the Singing Bird”
Once upon a time, there was a bird
that had a beautiful voice. The bird
lived at the top of the tallest tree in
the forest. Every morning, the bird
sang so beautifully that all the animals
in the forest felt glad to be alive.
One day, the bird far-away sang so
loudly and happily that the king in his
castle heard the beautiful melody. “I
want that bird,” shouted the king,
who was used to getting his own way.
Hunters brought the bird in a cage to
the king.
“Sing for me,” announced the king.
The bird refused.
“Then I’ll eat you for dinner,” said
the king.
The cook was afraid but the bird
told her not to worry. “Even a king
cannot destroy a beautiful idea,” the
bird said.The cook gently stroked the bird
before putting it into the pot. At
dinner, the king ate the bird. The king
started to swell up. He got the
wickedness of his life poured out to
him from all over the land.
Then, the people in the kingdom
heard a song more beautifully than
any they have ever heard before.
