                                            A. Face-to Face Classes a&gt; FACE TO FACE (The Philippine Star) December 1, 2020-12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended leaming. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning. Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task. Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resurning limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period. The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the Community Learning Hubs set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadge's or WiF) at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult leamers can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers. Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom leaming has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes. President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face dasses until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and indusive learning.​</a>

Identify the writing technique used in each number. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.1. CEBU CITY, Philippines - Local officials in Cebu City have reiterated their reminders to the public not to let their guard down just yet against the coronavirus. disease 2019 (COVID-19) now that December is just one sleep away. This as they discovered that most of the new confirmed cases of the infection has happened to be asymptomatic or infected individuals showing no symptoms of the disease.2. According to statistics, there is a 60.78% of the Filipino parents want their children to finish their studies, while 30.23% of them are saying that they just want their children to get a decent and permanent job someday, and the remaining 3.99\% are believing that skills will lead their children to a better day. From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year. Duque warned that the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases when they mingle. with family members from other areas. He also encouraged the use of teleconferencing instead to meet other family members.4. You get to follow to what our good leader is telling you for he is a man of faith, words, and action. Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6. Now, the darkest days and nights of our lives comes to an end as the most. reliable, most durable, most energy efficient, and unlike the leading brand, the brightest yet the cheapest LED LIGHT is now born.​​</a>

                            4. A. Face-to Face Classes a&gt; FACE TO FACE (The Philippine Star) December 1, 2020-12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended leaming. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning. Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task. Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resurning limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period. The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the Community Learning Hubs set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadge's or WiF) at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult leamers can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers. Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom leaming has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes. President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face dasses until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and indusive learning.​</h2><br />

According to statistics, there is a 60.78% of the Filipino parents want their children to finish their studies, while 30.23% of them are saying that they just want their children to get a decent and permanent job someday, and the remaining 3.99\% are believing that skills will lead their children to a better day. From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year. Duque warned that the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases when they mingle. with family members from other areas. He also encouraged the use of teleconferencing instead to meet other family members.4. You get to follow to what our good leader is telling you for he is a man of faith, words, and action. Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6.

                            11. EDITORIAL Face-to-face classes(The Philippine Star) - December 1, 2020 - 12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended learning. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning.Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task.Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resuming limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period.The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the "Community Learning Hubs" set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadgets or WiFi at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult learners can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers.Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom learning has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to face classes.President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and inclusive learning.16. What is the editorial text all about?A. Distance LearningB. Face to Face classesC. Online LearningD. DepEd order17. Which is the source of this editorial text?A. SchoolsB. The Philippine StarC. Learning hubD. Office of the Vice President18. Based on some reports, how did the student find the blended learning?A. They enjoy online learning with their parents.B. Students have encountered difficulties in blended learning.C. Parents were good tutors for their children.D. All students are happy with their private space for learning at home.19. What is the function of the learning hub?A. A hub similar to internet shop where children can have face to faceclass.B. It is a room for face to face classes.C. A hub where students can surf and attend online classes. D. It is a place where children without gadget or wifi can access the internet for their online classes, and the difficult learners can also have tutor.20. Do you agree with the decision of President Rodrigo Duterte wherein he says, "there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available," why or why not?​</h2><br />

CategoryIn the News·         Date PublishedJan 09, 2023National Achievement Test for Grade 12 students setMANILA, Philippines — Grade 12 students from public and private schools will be taking the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the end of the month.In a memorandum released on Jan. 5, Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said the exit assessment, which was designed to be “progressive in nature,” would be administered on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.“DepEd has to identify and articulate indicators and targets for measuring performance in the development of plans and policies,” he said.The test results will serve as data and evidence in improving the implementation of the curriculum, as well as evidence-based decision-making.According to Densing, the test items would measure varying levels of skills through a multiple-choice paper-based format.“It is designed to determine if graduating learners are meeting the learning standard in the senior high school (SHS) curriculum,” he said.The NAT result will also give insight into the percentage of Grade 12 students who have the minimum level of proficiency in the fourth stage of the SHS core areas.The test will cover 21st-century skills and the primary learning topics in SHS including languages, humanities, communication, mathematics, science, social science, and philosophy.An online national orientation was held on Jan. 6 to issue the specific guidelines for the test administration and the tasks of field-testing personnel and download of program support funds by the schools’ division office.In a study published last year, the government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) pointed out that failure to let the public know about the NAT results had contributed to the ongoing education crisis.“Even though we continuously administer national achievement tests, the results are never granularly available for in-depth analysis and even less public discussion,” said the report authored by PIDS president Aniceto Orbeta Jr. and research fellow vicente paqueo help!!​</h2><br />
