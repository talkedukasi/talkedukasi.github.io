Eyebrows are part of the face which serve two purposes- for beauty and protection. Eyebrowsmake the face more beautiful by calling the attention to the eyes. They make the eyes look healthier and brighter.2. Old clothes, scraps of cloth, old newspapers and magazines, worn-out stockings, and manydiscarded things can be made useful. They can be made into toys, placemats, potholders, pillow slip covers or evenflowers. When properly made, these articles can be given away as gifts, or used at home for household purposes, orbe sold to earn money, One doesn't have to buy new materials to produce something new. Next time you want tothrow, "used old things", stop a while. You may be able to make something new out of them. (Capili et al, DevelopingReading Power 5, St. Mary's Publishing, p.180 )3.

Capili, et al.          Mang Selo lived in a barrio. Everyday, he made brooms and baskets. On Sundays he sold them in the town market.H e earned enough for himself, his wife and son.          However, Mang SELO'S was always daydreaming. He wished time would come when he would not work anymore. He would just be eating, sleeping and taking a walk. Then, he would be very happy, he thought so.          Many years passed. His son finished high school. He became a salesman in a big store in the city. He earned more than enough for himself, his father and mother.          Right away, Mang Selo stopped working.  He only ate, slept, went to the movies and read newspapers.          Soon, Mang Selo lay on his bed most of the day. He did not like to eat. He did not to read or even go to the movies.          His wife called a doctor. The doctor looked at him all over the said "There's nothing wrong with you. You are getting weak because you do nothing. Your medicine is work. You have to work as you did before".          Mang Selo worked just as he did before and sure enough, he became strong and happy once more.Title:____________________Author:____________________Characters:____________________Settings:____________________Beginning:___________________________________________________________________________________________________.Middle:_______________________________________________________________________________________________________.Ending:______________________________________________________________________________________________________________.​</a>

Ang politika batay sa maraming karanasan ng mga tao ay nagkakaroon ng kahulugang "marumi, pandaraya, panlilinlang sa mga tao at pang-aabuso sa kapangyarihan." Batay sa kahulugan ng diksiyunaryo, ang politika ay may kaugnayan sa mga prinsipyo at pamamaraan sa pagbuo at pamamalakad ng pamahalaan. Nangangahulugan din itong masining at mahusay na pakikipag-ugnayan sa mga tao at bansa. Kung gayon, ang politika ay hindi sadyang masama at marumi. Sumasama lamang ito kung ang mga taong kasangkot dito ay nakalilimot sa kabutihan. Talagang matatag na paninindigan ang katangiang dapat taglayin ng mga taong kasangkot sa politika. Ito ang kailangan ng ating bansa sa kasalukuyan - mga pinuno at lingkod bayang may matibay na paninindigan. 'Paninindigan' ni: Teresita P. Capili- Sayo PAGSALUNGAT: PAGSANG-AYON: 2. Ngunit sadyang mapaglinlang ang panlabas na kaanyuan ng isang tao. Hindi natin alam na ang nasa loob ng mga paninging nakatatakot ay mga matang nagmamakaawa, nagsusumamo, humihingi ng kahit kaunting panahon. At hindi rin natin alam na sa likod ng maangas na anyo ay isang mabait na nilalang. Isang katauhang naghihirap ang kalooban. Oo, hindi natin alam at hindi malalaman ang mga ito dahil napakalakas ng dating sa atin ng suot nilang maskara. 'Alin ang Tunay na Totoo' ni: Marites V.

                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

The riots lasted a few days, and spread to surrounding suburbs.In 2005 tensions between British (White) Australians and immigrants were lit by a confrontation between teenageand young adult Middle Eastern immigrants and young Anglo-Australians around thebeaches. The mostly White Cronulla area youth resented incursions by the Middle Eastern youths from othersuburbs, people the White youths called 'Westies." Minor confrontations and fights, not unusual during theAustralian summer in beach areas between youth groups, built up into the incident known as the CronullaRiots.The riot has continued over the next couple days with threats, vandalism, and violence. Many were injuredinduding the police officers and immigrants as they were beaten with baseball bat and thrown with rocks.Altogether, 51 people were arrested in Cronulla at the original riots, and another 53 were arrested in surroundingsuburbs over the next few days. Those 104 arrestees faced 285 criminal charges.​​</a>

                        <strong>Tomas Lluisma Cabili </strong>(Marso 7, 1903 - Marso 17, 1957) ay isang abogado, mamamahayag, tagapagturo, at taga-lahi mula sa Lanao. Siya ay kilala rin bilang Sultan sa Dimasangkay-ko-Ranao para sa Maranoas.<br />

                            2. What is the moral lesson of Cronulla beach by: Jose Wendell Capili​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is the importance of the poem’s setting?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The importance of the poem’s setting is that it gives life to the poem that makes it more imaginable for the reader to read and also it provides knowledge about how Cronulla Beach witness the conflict between the white and colored people.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Why is it ironic that the beach used to be an “aboriginal landscape”?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>I have two reason why it is ironic that the beach used to be an “aboriginal landscape”. First, because I think the beach is said to be native but it is not really the true definition of it yet it represent the battle field where it witness the event on how the colored defeat the white people. And another thing is that it said to be ironic because the beach is a property of all Australian people but the colored and white people who are both Australian are fighting just to conquer that beach.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>What does it mean that there are generations who want to keep themselves “pure and sterile”? What does this say about immigration issues in Australia?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>It means that they will stay to be pure “white” or “Australian” asthey are and they don’t want to have a union or combination of a foreign blood in their family and because of this, I think racism is a major problem to those foreign people who wants to migrate in Australia.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Why did the white men rampage against colored people? How do you feel about this?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>White men rampage against colored people because they are racist. They hate those people who are not like them and because of this, I feel scared and mad towards the white men. Having this kind of act is not tolerable because they are simply not respecting people’s race.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Why did the colored people take their revenge? How do you feel about this?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Colored people take their revenge because I think they are hurt and also there’s no patience left in them. I feel sad and angry at the same time because they just made themselves look like the white people.  We don’t have to fight physically or take revenge if we have conflict. Talking to them and using the law can help to solve the problems between two parties.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>In this discussion about immigration and race, where does the Filipino come in? Why is it an important concern for Filipinos?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Filipinos became a subject to the topic “immigration and race” becauseas a Filipino, we always want to have a good place to live in and sometimes we desire to live in other countryto explore, travel and to have a peaceful living and another important thing in the Philippines, where Labor Migration is dominant for the people who are looking for jobs, Filipinos want to have bigger income so they tend leave their family to work in abroad or rather to stay there for good and because of that, it is an important concern for Filipinos about this kind of matter.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The pink seashells in the story gradually turned into sand. What could this be a symbol of? Explain.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Peace is a period where there are no conflicts, arguments or wars.  Peace will give you a very beautiful feeling towards humanity. Just like the pink seashell that represent peace, so beautiful and amazing to look and to feel. Crashing it by turning into sand is like turning peace into dust. Argumentswill arise, riots will start and violent actions will commence.  And because of that, this will symbolize as the beginning of war.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>There is juxtaposition of the image of the riots with a postcard. Why was this done?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>I think this is done to remember the conflict happened in the Cronulla beach which both white and colored people are injured and hurt. This can be way to recall the past and to have a lesson regarding the riots.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Did the poem change the way you look at living or working abroad? Did it change the way you view Australia? Why or why not?
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Australia is one of the most beautiful places to have a vacation, to work or even to live.  But because of the poem, it change my views about Australia. And as far as I know, many people especially in different countries prevails racism or inequality and I don’t want to raise my children in that kind of country, because we are against and we don’t tolerate that kind of attitude towards humanity. We, as Filipinos, have a culture to love and respect people with different races or beliefs in life.

Eyebrows are part of the face which serve two purposes- for beauty and protection. Eyebrowsmake the face more beautiful by calling the attention to the eyes. They make the eyes look healthier and brighter.2. Old clothes, scraps of cloth, old newspapers and magazines, worn-out stockings, and manydiscarded things can be made useful. They can be made into toys, placemats, potholders, pillow slip covers or evenflowers. When properly made, these articles can be given away as gifts, or used at home for household purposes, orbe sold to earn money, One doesn't have to buy new materials to produce something new.

Mang Selo lived in a barrio. Everyday, he made brooms and baskets. On Sundays he sold them in the town market.H e earned enough for himself, his wife and son.          However, Mang SELO'S was always daydreaming. He wished time would come when he would not work anymore. He would just be eating, sleeping and taking a walk. Then, he would be very happy, he thought so.          Many years passed. His son finished high school. He became a salesman in a big store in the city. He earned more than enough for himself, his father and mother.          Right away, Mang Selo stopped working.  He only ate, slept, went to the movies and read newspapers.          Soon, Mang Selo lay on his bed most of the day. He did not like to eat. He did not to read or even go to the movies.          His wife called a doctor. The doctor looked at him all over the said "There's nothing wrong with you. You are getting weak because you do nothing. Your medicine is work. You have to work as you did before".          Mang Selo worked just as he did before and sure enough, he became strong and happy once more.Title:____________________Author:____________________Characters:____________________Settings:____________________Beginning:___________________________________________________________________________________________________.Middle:_______________________________________________________________________________________________________.Ending:______________________________________________________________________________________________________________.​</h2><br />

Ang politika batay sa maraming karanasan ng mga tao ay nagkakaroon ng kahulugang "marumi, pandaraya, panlilinlang sa mga tao at pang-aabuso sa kapangyarihan." Batay sa kahulugan ng diksiyunaryo, ang politika ay may kaugnayan sa mga prinsipyo at pamamaraan sa pagbuo at pamamalakad ng pamahalaan. Nangangahulugan din itong masining at mahusay na pakikipag-ugnayan sa mga tao at bansa. Kung gayon, ang politika ay hindi sadyang masama at marumi. Sumasama lamang ito kung ang mga taong kasangkot dito ay nakalilimot sa kabutihan. Talagang matatag na paninindigan ang katangiang dapat taglayin ng mga taong kasangkot sa politika.

                            9. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />

The riots lasted a few days, and spread to surrounding suburbs.In 2005 tensions between British (White) Australians and immigrants were lit by a confrontation between teenageand young adult Middle Eastern immigrants and young Anglo-Australians around thebeaches. The mostly White Cronulla area youth resented incursions by the Middle Eastern youths from othersuburbs, people the White youths called 'Westies." Minor confrontations and fights, not unusual during theAustralian summer in beach areas between youth groups, built up into the incident known as the CronullaRiots.The riot has continued over the next couple days with threats, vandalism, and violence. Many were injuredinduding the police officers and immigrants as they were beaten with baseball bat and thrown with rocks.Altogether, 51 people were arrested in Cronulla at the original riots, and another 53 were arrested in surroundingsuburbs over the next few days. Those 104 arrestees faced 285 criminal charges.​​</h2><br />
