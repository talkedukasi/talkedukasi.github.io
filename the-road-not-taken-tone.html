Nathaniel Hawthorne opens his novel, The Scarlet Letter, with a paragraphthat depicts a crowd assembled in front of a prison door. The people are waiting forHester Prynne to show up with her scarlet letter "A." The author describes the crowdas a "throng. suggesting a mob-like and densely packed group. The mood is notpleasant, but somber - displayed by their "sad-colored" garments, hoods, and gray8.hats. Another interesting description about the men's hats is that they were steeple-crowned, which suggests that the people of the town are associated with thechurch that had punished Hester. The author's description of women as "intermixed"with men, alludes to the people in town lacking individuality. The use of passivevoice was assembled" further implies lack of individuality._2. Speedometer is a device used for measuring the speed of a vehicle.3. In the final stanza of his poem The Road Not Taken, Frost talks abouthis dilemma of coming upon two diverging paths, and not knowing which one tochoose. The third line is very important, as it delivers an idea of choosing between thetwo divergent paths.The tone in this stanza shifts from regretful to optimistic. The tive roads symbolicallyrepresent individual choices. The mood is neither depressed nor unhappy, but thepoet sighs because he knows what the complexities our life may have for him. Whetherhe has chosen a right or a wrong path, it has a compelling impact on his life.The phrase "less traveled suggests the theme of individualism.4. "Could you repeat the concept about mammals?5.

THE ROAD NOT TAKEN BY: ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. 1.

The mood is notpleasant, but somber - displayed by their "sad-colored" garments, hoods, and gray8.hats. Another interesting description about the men's hats is that they were steeple-crowned, which suggests that the people of the town are associated with thechurch that had punished Hester. The author's description of women as "intermixed"with men, alludes to the people in town lacking individuality. The use of passivevoice was assembled" further implies lack of individuality._2. Speedometer is a device used for measuring the speed of a vehicle.3. In the final stanza of his poem The Road Not Taken, Frost talks abouthis dilemma of coming upon two diverging paths, and not knowing which one tochoose. The third line is very important, as it delivers an idea of choosing between thetwo divergent paths.The tone in this stanza shifts from regretful to optimistic. The tive roads symbolicallyrepresent individual choices. The mood is neither depressed nor unhappy, but thepoet sighs because he knows what the complexities our life may have for him.
