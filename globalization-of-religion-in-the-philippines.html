A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</a>

                                            Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</a>

                                            The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>upon the step of the spanish on cebu, they propagated Christianity. The first from of globalization is the galleon trade, but not considered because as defined, major continents must have the transaction, thus claiming the Silk road to be the first trading system coined for globalization. Before the colonial period we had already the religion animism, but then changed when spanish came. After the colonization of the Spaniards, we are again introduced by Americans to Protestantism. And in addition to Spanish times, spaniards cannot colonized Mindanao because of Muslims. The Island of Mindanao is far streatched from the mainlands of Visayas but near to neighboring countries which have religions of Islam. In conclusion, due to interconnectedness of the countries, religions are globalized.</p><br />

                            8. pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</h2><br />

                            10. Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</h2><br />

                            13. The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</h2><br />
