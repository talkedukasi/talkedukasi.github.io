                                            Performance Task: Let's do this!
Materials: Grid paper, Philippine new coins (1, 5 and 10 peso coins), ruler, and pen.
Procedures:
A. Center (0,0)
1. Use the grid paper below and draw 3 sets of Cartesian coordinate plane. Use
1 unit in labelling the x- and y- axes.
2. Locate the center (0,0) of each 3 sets of Cartesian plane by putting a visible
dots.
3. Place each coin (designated set) at the center or on the dot in each Cartesian
plane. Using pen, draw a circle by tracing the circumference (edge) of the
each coin.
4. After you draw, remove the coins. From the center (dot), draw a line to any
point of the circle.
5. Get your ruler, measure in centimeters the line (radius) you created in each
Cartesian plane and record the values.
6. Solve the equation of each circle using the obtained value of the radius.
7. Compare the equation obtained and make an observation note of the activity</a>

                                            Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</a>

Procedures:
A. Center (0,0)
1. Use the grid paper below and draw 3 sets of Cartesian coordinate plane. Use
1 unit in labelling the x- and y- axes.
2. Locate the center (0,0) of each 3 sets of Cartesian plane by putting a visible
dots.
3. Place each coin (designated set) at the center or on the dot in each Cartesian
plane. Using pen, draw a circle by tracing the circumference (edge) of the
each coin.
4. After you draw, remove the coins. From the center (dot), draw a line to any
point of the circle.
5. Get your ruler, measure in centimeters the line (radius) you created in each
Cartesian plane and record the values.
6. Solve the equation of each circle using the obtained value of the radius.
7. Compare the equation obtained and make an observation note of the activity</h2><br />

                            19. Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</h2><br />
