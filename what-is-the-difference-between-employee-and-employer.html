                            11. Do you think employers must choose between agreeable employees and top performers? why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Do you think employers must choose between agreeable employees and top performers? Whyor why not? (20 points)No, it is a weak criteria to limit employer’s options between agreeable employees andtop performers. I believe that there are a lot of criteria need to be considered and it depends onwhat the qualities are being demanded or the nature of the job. Not all top performers tend to bedisagreeable employees and not all agreeable employees tend to perform less.Being agreeable is a personal trait of an employee, this means it’s a trait embeded to aperson and it is out of control of an employer. Being agreeable does not mean always agreeingwith  another  opinion  but  it’s about  being  in  harmony  working  with others. Agreeable  trait iscommon to new employee as they are considered as beginners in a certain field. They tend tolisten, be kind, be collaborative and to always follow instructions which results to meeting theexpectations and allowing their skills to grow.Being a top performer is a trait affected by external factors, this means that performanceof an employee is driven by the motivation, engagement and support provided from the leader.Top performers are considered as experts, all experts started as beginners and all beginnershas been once agreeable to their masters. Overall, an employer doesn’t necessarily need to choose  from the  two as these  arestages of an employee development. A leader/employer plays an important part on developingagreeable employees into becoming performers and with combination of leader’s/managementmotivation they can produce top performers. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps</p><p></p>-A<p></p><br />
