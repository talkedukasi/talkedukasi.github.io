                                            You have recently moved to Taguig City and have found employment as a financial manager of a multi-national firm. The company's operations are all related to manufacturing, and it has, as its principal asset, two large manufacturing plants in Nasugbu and Balayan. The company is owned by the two directors a married couple who are actively engaged in the day-to-day running of the business.You get on well with the directors and staff, and the directors of the company are clearly popular and well respected in the local community. You are still within your probationary period of employment. The company had faced some serious cash flow difficulties shortly before you took up your post. However, a re-mortgaging arrangement has, apparently, eased the financial pressure. The managing director comes to you with a company cheque for P200,000.00, which he has already signed. He asks for your countersignature, explaining that it is the deposit for the design work and equipment for the Balayan manufacturing plant. There is a formal sales invoice from ABC Corporation, but you are surprised as you were not aware that any such expenditure had been planned. Nevertheless, given the explanation and the supporting invoice, you countersign the cheque. Out of curiosity, you decide to conduct some research into the ABC Corporation. This indicates that it is a company that had, in the past, a high level of indebtedness. You note that the company secretary appears to be a close family relative of the directors for whom you work.Two days later, the managing director comes to you with another cheque, this time for P1,675,000.00, again needing only your countersignature. There is a supporting invoice from the ABC Corporation. You are hesitant, and the managing director explains that he is only asking you to countersign the cheque because his partner is not in the office. He says that it is important to submit the cheque promptly so that it may be banked before Nov. 15, 2022. Then, you ask why there is such urgency, particularly as there is no evidence of any machine or equipment delivered. The managing director laughs and replies that the money should be back in your company's bank account by the middle of January 2023. He explains that the cheques are needed urgently to settle outstanding directors' loan accounts at the ABC Corporation, as its year end is approaching. Once the year end has passed, the money should be returned to the company and a supporting credit note received.Question:As the Business Manager, what course of action would you take to resolve the dilemma?

Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community.

These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</a>

                            8. You have recently moved to Taguig City and have found employment as a financial manager of a multi-national firm. The company's operations are all related to manufacturing, and it has, as its principal asset, two large manufacturing plants in Nasugbu and Balayan. The company is owned by the two directors a married couple who are actively engaged in the day-to-day running of the business.You get on well with the directors and staff, and the directors of the company are clearly popular and well respected in the local community. You are still within your probationary period of employment. The company had faced some serious cash flow difficulties shortly before you took up your post. However, a re-mortgaging arrangement has, apparently, eased the financial pressure. The managing director comes to you with a company cheque for P200,000.00, which he has already signed. He asks for your countersignature, explaining that it is the deposit for the design work and equipment for the Balayan manufacturing plant. There is a formal sales invoice from ABC Corporation, but you are surprised as you were not aware that any such expenditure had been planned. Nevertheless, given the explanation and the supporting invoice, you countersign the cheque. Out of curiosity, you decide to conduct some research into the ABC Corporation. This indicates that it is a company that had, in the past, a high level of indebtedness. You note that the company secretary appears to be a close family relative of the directors for whom you work.Two days later, the managing director comes to you with another cheque, this time for P1,675,000.00, again needing only your countersignature. There is a supporting invoice from the ABC Corporation. You are hesitant, and the managing director explains that he is only asking you to countersign the cheque because his partner is not in the office. He says that it is important to submit the cheque promptly so that it may be banked before Nov. 15, 2022. Then, you ask why there is such urgency, particularly as there is no evidence of any machine or equipment delivered. The managing director laughs and replies that the money should be back in your company's bank account by the middle of January 2023. He explains that the cheques are needed urgently to settle outstanding directors' loan accounts at the ABC Corporation, as its year end is approaching. Once the year end has passed, the money should be returned to the company and a supporting credit note received.Question:As the Business Manager, what course of action would you take to resolve the dilemma? (5 sentences ONLY)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As the Business Manager, I would immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. I would start by verifying the authenticity of the invoices and the existence of the equipment and design work that the cheques were supposedly paying for. I would also seek clarification from the directors regarding the nature of the expenditure and the urgency of the payments. If the directors are unable to provide satisfactory answers, I would consider halting the payments and seeking legal advice to protect the interests of the company. I would also review the company's internal control procedures to ensure that similar situations do not arise in the future. Finally, I would maintain a professional and discreet approach throughout the process to avoid any damage to the company's reputation.</p><br />

These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2.

Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</h2><br />
