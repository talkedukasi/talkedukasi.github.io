The moon saw the little leaves dancing. Each looked like a small brown bird The man in the moon smiled and listened And this is the song he heard. The North Wind is calling, is calling, And we must whirl round and round, And then, when our dancing is ended, We&#039;ll make a warm quilt for the ground. Answer the following questions 1. How were the leaves described in the poem? 2. Who saw the leaves dancing? 3. If you were the moon, what would you do? 4. What feeling did the moon show? 5. Why do you think he was happy? 6.
