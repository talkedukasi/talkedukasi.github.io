                                            B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

Directions: Read the story Footnote To Youth and find out how the story is influenced by culture, history and environment, then do the activity that follows. Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire. He, still a teenager wants to marry the girl of his dreams, Tena.Dodong realizes how history is repeating itself and warns Blas about the consequences of such a massive decision. However, like father like son, he ends up following the same route and marries his sweetheart at 17 years of age.1.	Why do you think the author chose the rural community for the setting?A.

                                            TAMAYO BEAUTY SALON After finishing a cosmetology course with hair culture in 2005 at the Ricky and David School of Beauty in Santa Rosa City, Miss Rosemarie Tamayo decided to put up a salon business. Miss Tamayo worked with a local beauty parlor. In charge of income, her efforts made a significant contribution to the improvement of the salon's gross revenue. After two years, she thought that her career was at a dead-end, so she moved to a new business. She put up a new business such as massage and spa in the same locality. Her new line of business gives her a chance to meet prominent families in the community. This exposed her to the entrepreneurial spirit prevalent among local businesspeople. She witnessed how simple-looking folk became prosperous in a short period.Miss Tamayo thought that she had better chances in the massage and spa business. After three years, the firm's average monthly sales were P150,000. Except for the manual labor provided by her three hairdressers, Miss Tamayo was personally handling every facet of the spa and massage activity, from purchasing raw materials to actual delivery of service to the customers.In spite her initial success, Miss Tamayo dreamed of running a bigger place. She thought that if she would have to grow, she must increase her output in terms of market share. It was very timely because the customers were already complaining about the very limited hairdressers and masseuses. As if to add to her burden, a friend from a nearby town asked if she can offer a franchise. The foregoing developments led Miss Tamayo to consider hiring more persons. However, she was at loss on what exact assistance she wanted, making her recruitment activities a little difficult.  From the situation above, develop a marketing strategy for the business. Use additional short coupon bond. First,​</a>

Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.

                            5. B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            7. B.	Directions: Read the story Footnote To Youth and find out how the story is influenced by culture, history and environment, then do the activity that follows. Footnote to Youth Jose Garcia VillaIn this story, we come across such a young pair of Dodong and Teang. They are completely enamoured with each other and want to tie the wedding knot even though they are still teenagers. Dodong is adamant in his pursuit of Teang who happens to have another suitor, Lucio. He is much older and well settled in his life. But Teang follows her heart and chooses Dodong. Dodong has a hard time convincing his father about his decision to marry. He wants his son to weigh all the pros and cons and then make an informed decision. However, Dodong is not to be moved from his resolution. In the end, they both get married and begin a hopeful journey together. The next year Teang gives birth to their first child. This reality hits them hard. They are teen parents and realize the enormity of their responsibility. Taking care of children and building a family is a serious thing. In the next seven years, their family grows to a total of nine with seven kids. Teang now regrets her decision especially looking at Lucio who is still childless (after marrying another girl). She wonders if she would have the same fate if she had picked Lucio. But she dismisses such fleeting thought. Both of them are still devoted to each other and their large family. After some years, fate reverses time and now their firstborn, Blas comes to them with the same desire.

                            15. TAMAYO BEAUTY SALON After finishing a cosmetology course with hair culture in 2005 at the Ricky and David School of Beauty in Santa Rosa City, Miss Rosemarie Tamayo decided to put up a salon business. Miss Tamayo worked with a local beauty parlor. In charge of income, her efforts made a significant contribution to the improvement of the salon's gross revenue. After two years, she thought that her career was at a dead-end, so she moved to a new business. She put up a new business such as massage and spa in the same locality. Her new line of business gives her a chance to meet prominent families in the community. This exposed her to the entrepreneurial spirit prevalent among local businesspeople. She witnessed how simple-looking folk became prosperous in a short period.Miss Tamayo thought that she had better chances in the massage and spa business. After three years, the firm's average monthly sales were P150,000. Except for the manual labor provided by her three hairdressers, Miss Tamayo was personally handling every facet of the spa and massage activity, from purchasing raw materials to actual delivery of service to the customers.In spite her initial success, Miss Tamayo dreamed of running a bigger place. She thought that if she would have to grow, she must increase her output in terms of market share. It was very timely because the customers were already complaining about the very limited hairdressers and masseuses. As if to add to her burden, a friend from a nearby town asked if she can offer a franchise. The foregoing developments led Miss Tamayo to consider hiring more persons. However, she was at loss on what exact assistance she wanted, making her recruitment activities a little difficult.  From the situation above, develop a marketing strategy for the business. Use additional short coupon bond. First,​</h2><br />

Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.
