1.Computer programmers cannot use different algorithmic paths or steps to arrive at an ending or conclusion. 
2.In Imperative (Procedural) Programming, each step in the process is necessary before the next step can be done and the last step in the procedure always results in the desired outcome. 
3.Programming languages such as BASIC, Pascal, FORTRAN are some of the programming languages under object-oriented programming. 
4.Object-oriented programming is the paradigm that emphasizes the components of a program, called objects, rather than actions performed by the program. 
5.When objects are grouped together based on their operations, functions, and behaviors, they are called an algorithm. 
6.Imperative Programming emphasizes the problem solved rather than the steps needed to produce an outcome. 
7.Logic Programming is a computing paradigm also known as rule-based programming. 
8.In logic programming to identify a particular animal, you need to establish some rules to evaluate the aspects that need to be identified. 
9.Like us, computers need to follow certain steps to be able to solve problems or finish a task. 
10.Logic programming tends to explain how a command is done rather than what effect it can have 
11.When you do programming, you are giving commands to the computer. 
12.The language of computers is just the same as what we humans are using when talking. 
13.We must follow certain rules in writing a computer program. 
14.We don’t have to specify the data to be used in programming. 
15.A programming language cannot have both qualities of compiled and interpreted languages.</a>

In a laboratory, a small sample of something like cells, plasma, tissues, or any part from an organ or organism that represents a whole are used from which a diagnosis is rendered or other determination of said object's nature is made. These samples are called specimens. In determining the characteristics of these samples, these specimens are examined under a microscope. Do you want to know the procedure on how to focus the specimens? Examine the illustrations below. What can you tell about each illustration? 1. 3. 2. 4. Now, start your learning journey and work on the learning tasks presented in the succeeding pages of this lesson. Although you may not be able to get hold of the actual microscope, the learning tasks will provide you exciting opportunity to explore the basic mechanism of a microscope. ENJOY LEARNING.​</a>

                            19. answer this true or false 
1.Computer programmers cannot use different algorithmic paths or steps to arrive at an ending or conclusion. 
2.In Imperative (Procedural) Programming, each step in the process is necessary before the next step can be done and the last step in the procedure always results in the desired outcome. 
3.Programming languages such as BASIC, Pascal, FORTRAN are some of the programming languages under object-oriented programming. 
4.Object-oriented programming is the paradigm that emphasizes the components of a program, called objects, rather than actions performed by the program. 
5.When objects are grouped together based on their operations, functions, and behaviors, they are called an algorithm. 
6.Imperative Programming emphasizes the problem solved rather than the steps needed to produce an outcome. 
7.Logic Programming is a computing paradigm also known as rule-based programming. 
8.In logic programming to identify a particular animal, you need to establish some rules to evaluate the aspects that need to be identified. 
9.Like us, computers need to follow certain steps to be able to solve problems or finish a task. 
10.Logic programming tends to explain how a command is done rather than what effect it can have 
11.When you do programming, you are giving commands to the computer. 
12.The language of computers is just the same as what we humans are using when talking. 
13.We must follow certain rules in writing a computer program. 
14.We don’t have to specify the data to be used in programming. 
15.A programming language cannot have both qualities of compiled and interpreted languages.</h2><br />

In a laboratory, a small sample of something like cells, plasma, tissues, or any part from an organ or organism that represents a whole are used from which a diagnosis is rendered or other determination of said object's nature is made. These samples are called specimens. In determining the characteristics of these samples, these specimens are examined under a microscope. Do you want to know the procedure on how to focus the specimens? Examine the illustrations below. What can you tell about each illustration? 1. 3. 2. 4. Now, start your learning journey and work on the learning tasks presented in the succeeding pages of this lesson. Although you may not be able to get hold of the actual microscope, the learning tasks will provide you exciting opportunity to explore the basic mechanism of a microscope. ENJOY LEARNING.​</h2><br />

Television is one of the least powerful tools in communicating information, especially in news broadcasting.1. Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place to another.2. A multimedia application may require the use of speech, music and sound effects.3. Graphics do not make the multimedia application attractive.4. Video clips can be edited easily.5. In a television broadcast, the director should use a series of standards, calls and set procedures to direct the efforts ofthe video crew6. The digital video files can be stored like any other files in the computer and the quality of the video can still bemaintained.7. The video files can be transferred within a computer network it allows non-linear editing in any part of the video.8. A consistency of protocol does not allow the crew to anticipate their responsibilities by following standard operatingocedures with clearly defined and universally understood jargon[').9. Text is the basic element of multimedia.10. Communications can be spoken or verbal communication: face-to-face, telephone, radio or television and otherdia or non-verbal communication: body language, gestures, how we dress or act our scent.​</h2><br />
