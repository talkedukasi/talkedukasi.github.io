Find outIn the story you are going to read.The Origin of Rice and Small StreamsOnce upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, butthey were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors andsometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did notcomplain but went on living each day as best as they could.Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the nextvillage to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hillypaths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. Theimpact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to getback on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could noteven stand.The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young womanemerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An oldwoman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me whatyou need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blindand I cannot work for a living in the fields."The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They boththanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived togetherhappily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep tothemselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned themagic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle pouredsome of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks andstreams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetchwater for their various needs.1. When did the story happen?2. Who were the characters?3. Describe the two blind women.4.

                                            The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</a>

                                            The Tinikling (bamboo dance) is a widely recognized traditional folk dance and national dance of the Philippines. It's said that during colonization in 1500s, natives worked too slowly would be punished by having their feet beaten by bamboo. Natives would jump to avoid being struck, their movemenis seem to imitate the long-legged Tinikling bird that quickly yet gratefully escapes rice field traps set by farmers. It's danced to an ensemble of stringed instruments which is influenced by Spanish rule. In its simplest forrn, the dance involves two people (clappers) hitting, sliding, clapping 12ft long bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in synchronization. Simultaneously the dancer/s step between and over the bamboo. More complex forms of the dance include 4 or more poles in cross formations and 4 or more clappers and dancers. Both women and men wear traditional dresses and must be barefoot. It takes practice, agility, coordination, and rhythm to keep from getting your ankles caught as the tempo speeds up and bamboo formations change.

                                            10. Early Filipinos follow a ritual in order for the rice to grow and prosper. In Sagada, village elders get to choose the day for the planting ritual. On the first day, no one has to work in the fields. On the next day, the fields are planted by noble women who inherited the role as ritual transplanter from their ancestors. Three days later, their children can start planting their fields. The rest of the people follow. In Ifugao province, a landowner has someone perform the ritual before using the rice seed in his granary. Two chickens must be sacrificed. After that, a female relative must plant the seeds in the mud before the seedbed is filled with water and cultivated. a. I. Ritual Practices A. In Ifugao     1. Meeting the elders    2.

                            9. The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This Ibaloy tale is structured in a traditional folktale format, beginning with the introduction of two blind women who are poor and must beg for food. The plot then follows their journey to the next village, where they encounter a magical rock that opens up and reveals an old woman who gives them a sack of rice and bottle of water that will never be empty or drained dry.

                            13. The Tinikling (bamboo dance) is a widely recognized traditional folk dance and national dance of the Philippines. It's said that during colonization in 1500s, natives worked too slowly would be punished by having their feet beaten by bamboo. Natives would jump to avoid being struck, their movemenis seem to imitate the long-legged Tinikling bird that quickly yet gratefully escapes rice field traps set by farmers. It's danced to an ensemble of stringed instruments which is influenced by Spanish rule. In its simplest forrn, the dance involves two people (clappers) hitting, sliding, clapping 12ft long bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in synchronization. Simultaneously the dancer/s step between and over the bamboo. More complex forms of the dance include 4 or more poles in cross formations and 4 or more clappers and dancers. Both women and men wear traditional dresses and must be barefoot. It takes practice, agility, coordination, and rhythm to keep from getting your ankles caught as the tempo speeds up and bamboo formations change. Note: Please read attached page for the additional information about the Tinikling dance. Direction: Answer the following questions and write your answer on the space provided. 1.

What are the important things to consider in performing the tinikling dance?<br /><br />All dancers perform the Tinikling while barefoot. While only two bamboo poles are involved in this dance, some versions use four bamboo poles, where the pairs are arranged in a cross-like pattern. To avoid getting their ankles caught in between the poles, dancers must listen closely and follow the rhythm of the music.<br /><br /><br />Brainliest pls :(<br /><br />

                            20. Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but theywere very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimesthey were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but wenton living each day as best as they could.Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next villageto try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths.When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact senttheir bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on theirfeet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand.The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged.She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seatedthem at a stone table and gave them food to eat. “Now tell what you need,” said the oldwoman to them when they had finished their meal.One of the blind women said, “I am always hungry. I need food, but I am too blindand I cannot work for a living in the fields.”The other replied, “I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too,am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring.”The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. Tothe other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They boththanked the old woman profusely and they felt their way back home. They livedtogether happily, never wanting any more than what they already had. After sometime, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the goodfortune that they had been given. So, the one who owned the magic sack of rice took ahandful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested she gave it to the peoplein the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out ontothe land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banksflowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their variousneeds.Source: The Origin of Tapuy and Other Cordillera Tales, Rosella Camte-Banhi,et.al pp.42-43When you read a selection it is very important to understand how your senses work.Your understanding of images will play a key role in appreciating the text.Write 5 words/phrases that appeal to your senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch).1.2.3,4,5,​</h2><br />
