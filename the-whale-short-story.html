                                            The biggest animal in the world is the whale. The blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived. It is even bigger than the great dinosaurs of long ago. Whales are close cousins of dolphins and porpoises. But these animals do not come as big as the whales. Whales spend their entire lives in water, usually in the ocean. Because they live in cold water, they have a thick layer of fat under their skin. This fat which is called blubber protects the animal from the cold. Though whales live in water, they are not fish. Whales are mammals. They have lungs through which they breathe. A whale comes to the surface to breathe. It blows the old air from its lungs out of a hole on the top of its head. Whales are warm blooded. Even if the temperature outside is very cold or hot, their body temperature remains steady. Whales have hair all over their bodies though not much. Mother whales feed their babies with milk from their own.Whales are very sociable animals. They talk with others by making different sounds. They make clicks, whistles, squeaks, thumps and even low moans. Because sound waves travel well in water, the songs of whales can be heard more than a hundred miles away.1. What is the story about?2.

                                            Hi guys pahelp naman po ako need kolang talaga salamat!! pabasa po muna story(Story)The biggest animal in the world is the whale. The blue whale is the largestanimal that ever lived. It is even bigger than the great dinosaurs of long ago.Whales are close cousins of dolphins and porpaises. But these animals do not come as big as the whales. Whales spend their entire lives in water, usually in the ocean. Because they live in cold water, they have a thick layer of fat under their skin. This fat which is called blubber, protects the animal from the cold. Though whales live in water, they are not fish. Whales are mammals. They have lungs through which they breathe. A whale comes to the surface to breathe. It blows the old air from its lungs out of a bole on the top of its head. Whales are warm blooded. Even if the temperature outside is very cold or hot, their body temperature remains steady. Whales have heir all over their bodies though not much. Mother whales feed their babies with milk from their own.Whales are very sociable animals. They talk with others by making differentsounds. They make clicks, whistles, squeaks, thumps and even low moans. Because sound waves travel well in water, the songs of whales can be heard more than a hundred miles away.​</a>

                                            es.How did the early whalers find whales? Here's Andy's story:"First, we waited for the whale to come to the surface of the sea tobreathe. This is called blowing or spouting. Then, we wait for the whale todive down again. Third, we go after the whale, riding in three small boats.One of the men in the first boat carries the harpoon or the weapon that willkill the whale. The men in the second boat help hold the line after thewhale is harpooned. And the men in the third boat come to help any manwho may be thrown or pulled into the water when the whale fights back.Fourth, the fight between the huge whale and the men begin. Finally, if themen win over the whale, they pull the huge creature into a big boat.23 how to make this in paragraph​</a>

                            5. The biggest animal in the world is the whale. The blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived. It is even bigger than the great dinosaurs of long ago. Whales are close cousins of dolphins and porpoises. But these animals do not come as big as the whales. Whales spend their entire lives in water, usually in the ocean. Because they live in cold water, they have a thick layer of fat under their skin. This fat which is called blubber protects the animal from the cold. Though whales live in water, they are not fish. Whales are mammals. They have lungs through which they breathe. A whale comes to the surface to breathe. It blows the old air from its lungs out of a hole on the top of its head. Whales are warm blooded. Even if the temperature outside is very cold or hot, their body temperature remains steady. Whales have hair all over their bodies though not much. Mother whales feed their babies with milk from their own.Whales are very sociable animals. They talk with others by making different sounds. They make clicks, whistles, squeaks, thumps and even low moans. Because sound waves travel well in water, the songs of whales can be heard more than a hundred miles away.1. What is the story about?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Whales have lungs for breathing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Whales are mammals because they have lung to <strong>breathe </strong><strong>or </strong><strong>breathing.</strong><strong> </strong>Mammals have covered in fur or hair that serves as protection. They have more developed organ systems, too! They heart has four chambers to efficiently circulate blood, and a strong diaphragm assists their breathing. Some mammals give birth to their offspring by other means, such as the monotremes.<strong> </strong><strong>Monotremes </strong>such as the spiny anteater the duck-billed platypus are egg-laying mammals. They share more characteristics with reptiles than mammals. Their mammary glands are also not as developed.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong></p><br />
