                                            Society enables people to become a better or worse person. At the end of the
day, with all the acquired information, beliefs, and norms, it will highly depend on
the person on how he/she will analyze things. Politics, economics, and
environment are the main concern of all these changes in the society which also led
to take away of the fact that mental health is also vital.
With the changes in the form of society, what else do you see in the near
future considering the unending needs, wants, and desires of a human person?
Critical Thinking Questions:
1. Do you agree with the statement that society enables people to become a
better or worse person? Why?
2. Do you believe that the changes in the form of society affects the mental
health of a human person? Why?
3. If you were to choose, which form of society do you think people can live
best? Why?</a>

                            7. Do you think humans can really live outside of society? Imagine being raised by an animal. What would happen when, after long years of living with animals, a person is placed in society? What would be the challenges? Do you think that person could forget what he “learned” from the animals?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think there has been a human that was raised by an animal before. I think it is possible to be raised by an animal, for instance, the "Dog Boy" from Chile, he was raised by monkeys because he was abandoned. I think what would happen if a person was raised by animals then put in society, is it would be a challenge for the person. He must adapt to the changes in society, like walking correctly, eating correctly, or even speaking correctly. I think the person will not forget what he learned from the animal because, first of all, he was raised by it, secondly he will treasure that memory, and lastly, he might even meet the animal again. Some memories though will be forgotten. As the person is taught how to act in society, he will adjust and shift his behavior from an animal-like to an actual human being. </p><p></p><br />

some values or virtues of a human person that will make-up your own idea of
society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Q1</p><p>To me, the world is a complicated place and today's standards of society make it even more difficult to live and act in one's own way.  I sometimes wonder what life would be like if we could start all over and build a brand new society - a society that guarantees social justice for all groups and full rights to every individual. From the beginning society has been judgmental in one way or another, rather it is through racism, sexism, or classicism.  </p><p></p><p>The roles of men and women have drastically altered the past century and men now take on some responsibilities that were once viewed as tasks of a woman.  As a result women have been able to advance their careers, express their political views, and have become equals next to men in society, which illustrates that had women not been discriminated against and viewed as the homemaker for so long, equality between men and women would have occurred ages ago.  In my vision of society an individual's sex would not inhibit one from fully participating in the activities of the community that he or she desired.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Q2.</p><p>Step back from a societal ideal and think of an individual ideal, and you will be on the right track, since any given society is composed of individuals and not a collective mind or hive mind. For an individual, his primary values ought to be reason, purpose, and self-esteem; and his virtues ought to be rationality, independence, honesty, productiveness, justice, pride, and integrity. These are the basic values and virtues that will lead to a man living his own life according to his own rational standards based on observation and context of his own making in coming to understand reality and what to do about the fact that he is alive and trying to do well. </p><br />

These towns would be pretty much equitably appropriated across the globe, approaching generally comparable measures of arable land. 30% of all land would be assigned wild, and no social orders would be permitted to colonize these regions, however withdrawn people would be allowed to possess the wild after a way of life of complete forlornness.
</p><p>
</p><p>Every general public would be run by an agreement of individuals, on a Rousseauian model of full investment of all individuals north of 14 and gathering order. Contradicting individuals will be welcome to move to elective <strong>social</strong> orders, set up their own ashore proportionate to the size of the disagreeing bunch, or to take to the wild. Committees might enact on shared interests, yet there will be no laws limiting private exercises gave these don't encroach upon similar opportunities of others.
</p><p>
</p><p>While every general public would conclude its own guidelines, the Confederation would regard a widespread constitution as per which nobody can claim anything they have not made. Common items could be traded openly among people or between <strong>social</strong> orders. There would be no cash, and no storing of commonly possessed assets, on agony of expulsion to the wild. Consistently there would be a Global Festival of Gratitude and Giving, during which gifts would be unreservedly traded and craftsmanship, music, moves and games would celebrate and restore the opportunity of the Earth from human mastery.

</p><p>As indicated by the constitution, creatures separated from the wild might be eaten throughout the colder time of year in chilly environments and during disease. However, there would be no training or other encroachment upon the opportunity of creatures. Killing would be permitted provided that human existence is at serious risk, or to settle populaces and natural concordance. All waste would be reused, and energy got uniquely from inexhaustible sources like breeze and tide.

Individuals would be welcome to join elective <strong>social</strong> orders, yet may emigrate just to one that has gotten no different individuals from the rebel society. All political connections will be totally inward to every general public and there would be no collusions shaped between <strong>social</strong> orders. Social orders endeavoring to shape political devotions or expand their power past their own individuals will be boycotted. People would be allowed to make a trip to and structure associations with people of different social orders, however any gathering becoming excessively huge for its arable assets would need to rearrange.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/4052115</strong></p><p><strong>#LETSSTUDY</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            17. What does it mean that the human person is naturally oriented toward society?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Social nature of human beings
</p><p>God did not create man as a “solitary being,” but wanted him to be a “social being”
</p><p>(cf. Gen 1:27; 2:18-20, 23). Life in society is not something “added-on” for the human
</p><p>person; it stems from an important dimension intrinsic to human nature. Human beings
</p><p>can grow and attain their calling in life only in union with others.1
</p><p>The social nature of the human person is even more evident in the light of faith, since
</p><p>there is a certain likeness between the intimate life of the Holy Trinity and the
</p><p>communion that should be established among mankind; all men and women have been
</p><p>redeemed by Christ and are called to share in the same end.2
</p><p> Revelation teaches us that
</p><p>human relationships should be marked by a deep gratuitousness, since in our neighbor we
</p><p>see, more than an equal, the living image of God, and we have to be ready to give
</p><p>ourselves fully, even to the ultimate extreme, for each one.3
</p><p> 
</p><p>Therefore each person “is called to exist ‘for’ others, to become a gift.”4
</p><p> Existing
</p><p>“for” others entails much more than just “co-existing” with them: it means serving them
</p><p>and loving them. Human freedom “can wither in an ivory-tower isolation brought on by
</p><p>an over indulgence in the good things of life.”5
</p><p>A personal and collective effort is needed to develop social relationships correctly:
</p><p>“The social nature of human beings does not automatically lead to communion among
</p><p>persons, to the gift of self. Because of pride and selfishness, man discovers in himself the
</p><p>seeds of asocial behavior, impulses leading him to close himself within his own
</p><p>individuality and to dominate his neighbor.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for--and in many cases is already affecting--a broad range of human and natural systems. The compelling case for these conclusions is provided in Advancing the Science of Climate Change, part of a congressionally requested suite of studies known as America's Climate Choices. While noting that there is always more to learn and that the scientific process is never closed, the book shows that hypotheses about climate change are supported by multiple lines of evidence and have stood firm in the face of serious debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations.</p><p></p><p>As decision makers respond to these risks, the nation's scientific enterprise can contribute through research that improves understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change and also is useful to decision makers at the local, regional, national, and international levels. The book identifies decisions being made in 12 sectors, ranging from agriculture to transportation, to identify decisions being made in response to climate change.</p><p></p><p>Advancing the Science of Climate Change calls for a single federal entity or program to coordinate a national, multidisciplinary research effort aimed at improving both understanding and responses to climate change. Seven cross-cutting research themes are identified to support this scientific enterprise. In addition, leaders of federal climate research should redouble efforts to deploy a comprehensive climate observing system, improve climate models and other analytical tools, invest in human capital, and improve linkages between research and decisions by forming partnerships with action-oriented programs.</p><p></p><p>Get Email Updates</p><p>National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2010.
