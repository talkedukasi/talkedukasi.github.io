                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

                            4. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well For me it's definitely Ki because even though unarmed and with a bad foot condition his ready to save/, sacrifice himself for his wife.</p><br />
