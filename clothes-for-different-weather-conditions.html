Weather is the continuous changing condition of air around us. These changes can take many different forms, including wind, rain and snow. It has five types such as sunny, cloudy, windy, snowy, and rainy. It is sunny when there is little to no presence of clouds. It is cloudy when the clouds form up a barrier to block the rays of the sun. At the same time, it also traps heat from the ground. It is windy, when wind gusts form as air is pushed into smaller and smaller spaces. In some countries, except tropical countries like the Philippines, they have snow. When the clouds are heavy enough, they cannot hold the water or snow anymore. They then fall in the form of raindrops, in the case of rain, or snowflakes, in the case of snow. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close- fitting clothes when it is cold.​</a>

Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1</p><p>Answer: B. Weather is the day-to-day condition of the atmosphere while climate is the average of all-weather conditions.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions like temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind that occur on a day-to-day basis. Climate, on the other hand, refers to long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation, and other weather elements in a particular area.</p><p>2</p><p>Answer: C. The higher the altitude, the colder the climate.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: As we go higher in the atmosphere, the air becomes thinner, and the pressure and temperature decrease. This is known as the lapse rate, and it causes the temperature to decrease by about 6.5°C for every 1,000 meters of altitude gain. Therefore, the higher the altitude, the colder the temperature.</p><p>3</p><p>Answer: B. The amount of water vapor is not enough.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: Altitude affects climate because the higher up you go, the colder it gets due to the decrease in air pressure and temperature. However, altitude alone is not enough to determine the climate of a place. The amount of water vapor, prevailing winds, ocean currents, and other factors also play a crucial role in determining the climate of a particular area.</p><p>4</p><p>Answer: A. The air condenses as it moves to the leeward side of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: When moist air rises over a mountain, it cools, and its water vapor condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. As the air moves down the other side of the mountain (leeward side), it warms up and dries out, causing the clouds to dissipate and resulting in a drier climate.</p><p>5</p><p>Answer: A. It causes a warm climate in the area.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: The West Australian Current is a warm ocean current that flows along the western coast of Australia, bringing warm water from the tropics towards the south. This current has a warming effect on the southwestern part of Australia and Singapore, resulting in a warm and humid climate in these areas.</p><p>6</p><p>Answer: C. Global Warming.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: Global warming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This increase in temperature causes a series of other environmental problems, such as rising sea levels, melting of glaciers and ice caps, and more frequent and severe weather events. La Nina, on the other hand, is a climate pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and results in cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns.</p><br />

Everyone also chooses the right clothes to wear like comfortable and light-colored clothes, the right food to eat like cold and refreshing food. We also drink plenty of water. Farmers harvest crops. People do their laundry, dry fish rice and other crops. Rainy Day This kind of weather is characterized by thick and dark clouds and rain continues to fail This time, farmers plant rice because of enough water. Everybody tends to wear thick and dark colored clothes like jackets and sweaters. Almost all folks eat warm food like soup People stay at home. Windy Day This is characterized by moderate to strong blowing of winds, the northeast and southwest monsoon (amihan and habagat) Children enjoy tlying kites and some recreational activities If the winds blow harder, people avoid sea travel. Stormy Day Typhoon happens in this kind of weather. It is characterized by different storm signal being raised so that people can crepare and secure themselves. The wind is blowing stronger. Some trees were uprooted. Houses made up of light materials are destroyed and flashflood happens. People are advised to stay at home and take necessary precautions and tune in to radio for the latest updates of the typhoon. PIVOT Families store enough food prepare the flashlights, candles, water, and other needs in case there is a need for evacuation ahead of time. The different weather conditions help us to make necessary preparations for the activities that we are going to do. Knowledge of the weather conditions also keep us safe and secured.​</h2><br />

Weather is the continuous changing condition of air around us. These changes can take many different forms, including wind, rain and snow. It has five types such as sunny, cloudy, windy, snowy, and rainy. It is sunny when there is little to no presence of clouds. It is cloudy when the clouds form up a barrier to block the rays of the sun. At the same time, it also traps heat from the ground. It is windy, when wind gusts form as air is pushed into smaller and smaller spaces. In some countries, except tropical countries like the Philippines, they have snow. When the clouds are heavy enough, they cannot hold the water or snow anymore. They then fall in the form of raindrops, in the case of rain, or snowflakes, in the case of snow. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes.
