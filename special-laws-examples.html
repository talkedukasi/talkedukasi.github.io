II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance
5. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same acceleration if air 
resistance is neglected.
6. In physics, an external force acting on an object over a specific time leads to a change in 
momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.
III. Enumeration:
two types of collisions
1.
2. 
Four(4) equations that can be used in solving for one-dimensional problems involving 
uniform acceleration.

When the volume is held constant, the pressure exerted by a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. These example problems use Gay-Lussac's law to find the pressure of gas in a heated container as well as the temperature you would need to change the pressure of gas in a container.</h2><br />
                        <p>Gay-Lussac's gas law is a special case of the ideal gas law where the volume of the gas is held constant. When the volume is held constant, the pressure exerted by a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. These example problems use Gay-Lussac's law to find the pressure of gas in a heated container as well as the temperature you would need to change the pressure of gas in a container.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Gay-Lussac's Law Example
</p><p>A 20-liter cylinder contains 6 atmospheres (atm) of gas at 27 C. What would the pressure of the gas be if the gas was heated to 77 C?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To solve the problem, just work through the following steps:
</p><p>
</p><p>The cylinder's volume remains unchanged while the gas is heated so Gay-Lussac's gas law applies. Gay-Lussac's gas law can be expressed as:
</p><p>
</p><p>Pi/Ti = Pf/Tf
</p><p>
</p><p>where
</p><p>Pi and Ti are the initial pressure and absolute temperatures
</p><p>Pf and Tf are the final pressure and absolute temperature
</p><p>
</p><p>First, convert the temperatures to absolute temperatures.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ti = 27 C = 27 + 273 K = 300 K
</p><p>Tf = 77 C = 77 + 273 K = 350 K
</p><p>
</p><p>Use these values in Gay-Lussac's equation and solve for Pf.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pf = PiTf/Ti
</p><p>Pf = (6 atm)(350K)/(300 K)
</p><p>Pf = 7 atm
</p><p>
</p><p>The answer you derive would be:
</p><p>
</p><p>The pressure will increase to 7 atm after heating the gas from 27 C to 77 C.
</p><p>
</p><p>Another Example
</p><p>See if you understand the concept by solving another problem: Find the temperature in Celsius needed to change the pressure of 10.0 liters of a gas that has a pressure of 97.0 kPa at 25 C to standard pressure. Standard pressure is 101.325 kPa.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First, convert 25 C to Kelvin (298K).  Remember that the Kelvin temperature scale is an absolute temperature scale based on the definition that the volume of a gas at constant (low) pressure is directly proportional to the temperature and that 100 degrees separate the freezing and boiling points of water.
</p><p>
</p><p>Insert the numbers into the equation to get:
</p><p>
</p><p>97.0 kPa / 298 K = 101.325 kPa / x
</p><p>
</p><p>solving for x:
</p><p>
</p><p>x = (101.325 kPa)(298 K)/(97.0 kPa)
</p><p>
</p><p>x = 311.3 K
</p><p>
</p><p>Subtract 273 to get the answer in Celsius.
</p><p>
</p><p>x = 38.3 C
</p><p>
</p><p>Tips and Warnings
</p><p>Keep these points in mind when solving a Gay-Lussac's law problem:
</p><p>
</p><p>The volume and quantity of gas are held constant.
</p><p>If the temperature of the gas increases, pressure increases.
</p><p>If temperature decreases, pressure decreases.
</p><p>Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of gas molecules. At a low temperature, the molecules are moving more slowly and will hit the wall of a containerless frequently. As temperature increases so do the motion of the molecules. They strike the walls of the container more often, which is seen as an increase in pressure.  </p><p>
</p><p>The direct relationship only applies if the temperature is given in Kelvin. The most common mistakes students make working this type of problem is forgetting to convert to Kelvin or else doing the conversion incorrectly. The other error is neglecting significant figures in the answer. Use the smallest number of significant figures given in the problem.

2. This occurs when an object experiences an increase or decrease in velocity at the 
same rate throughout the motion.
 a. Collision b. Uniformly accelerated motion c. Free fall motion
3. It refers to any motion of an object or body solely influenced by gravity. It means that 
the effect of air resistance is negligible and therefore has an insignificant effect on the 
falling object.

during which it acts: impulse. 
A. Law of Inertia b. law of motion c. law of interaction d. impulse
II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance
5. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same acceleration if air 
resistance is neglected.
6. In physics, an external force acting on an object over a specific time leads to a change in 
momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.
