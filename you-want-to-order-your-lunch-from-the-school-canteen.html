                            24. The School Lunch Counter A school canteen or lunch counter is established in every school to improve children's eating habits and preferences. Native, nutritious dishes such as goto, pancit and lumpia are prepared by a teacher with the help of some children. Sandwiches are also sold for those who prefer a light merienda. A good lunch counter has milk as a regular item for sale. Teachers encourage their pupils to include milk in their daily food intake. The canteen is part of a school. It protects children from sickness by discouraging them to buy from food peddlers and unsanitary, nearby stores. Pupils are asked to patronize the canteen for their own health. The low prices of food serve as an encouragement for the children to buy the from the school canteen. QUESTIONS: 1. What food can we buy in a school canteen? 2. How do school lunch counters help children? 3. Why should children avoid buying food outside the school?​</h2><br />
