                                            Read and analyze the situation below, then answer the question given. A typhoon severely damaged a certain place in Bundok Peninsula Quezon Province. The wealthiest family in that area who happened to have large businesses have thought of a way to help SME's or the small business enterprises to recover, as well as those poor families affected by the said typhoon. The family then decided to allot funds to lend to those who are victims of calamity by giving a simple interest loan for only 10% per annum. If the family was able to lend P1,500,000.00, how much interest would be earned after 5 years? Use a model table discussed in this lesson to show the simple interest earned. What do you think about Filipino values being shown in this situation? Can you think of other means to help the community with an application of simple interest? Your output will be graded, according to this rubric. Submit your answer in a PDF format.  ​</a>

Listen to the audio recording and answer the question.Audio Recording # 2:The Church of England's Children's Society recently redefined what itmeans by the word family. The word family came into English in the fifteenthcentury. Its root lies in the Latin word famulus, "servant". The first meaning inEnglish was close to our modern word "household"a group of individuals livingunder one roof that included blood relations and servants. A family influencesvalues and expectations of children that they observe from their parents andinternalize these values and expectations. Parents may teach values andexpectations to their children directly by teaching them and indirectly by example.As many children spend much of their time with their families, families are oftena primary source in the formation of values and expectations that greatly affecttheir development. Child development happens physically, emotionally, socially,and intellectually during early stage of a child's life. To make an analogy, if youwere constructing a large building, you have to make sure that it has a solidfoundation so that the rest of the building can stand tall and strong for many yearsto come.What information from the audio recording is relevant to you as member of thefamily?A.

                                            Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</a>

                                            Can someone paraphrase this paragraph in simpler words? Thanks a lot ❤️The Mindfulness-to-meaning Theory (MMT) by Garland, Farb, Goldin and Fredrickson (2015) was planned as a representation of mindful optimistic emotion regulation to fulfill the gap of formalized theory linking mindfulness to more lasting, positive indicators of health. The mindfulness-to-meaning theory (MMT) emphasizes that by altering how an individual attends to the cognitive, affective, and interoceptive abnormalcy of emotion incitement, mindfulness presents flexibility into the formation of autobiographical meaning, stimulating the normal human ability to positively reassess adverse endeavors and value the positive facets of experience. By nurturing positive reassessments and emotions, mindfulness may produce deep eudaimonic meanings that stimulate resilience and commitment with a valued and purposeful existence. The MMT was initially established to justify for the methods in mindfulness training, it might encourage optimistic emotion regulation, and the MMT does not identify the mindfulness meditation, but as an alternative stipulates structures involved in the state and attribute of mindfulness. For that reason, it may define trans-therapeutic procedures involving mindfulness to reconsiderations and positive affect that arise as an outcome of any psychological intermediation adept of stimulating state and attribute of mindfulness.​</a>

Listen to the audio recording and answer the question.Audio Recording # 2:The Church of England's Children's Society recently redefined what itmeans by the word family. The word family came into English in the fifteenthcentury. Its root lies in the Latin word famulus, "servant". The first meaning inEnglish was close to our modern word "household"a group of individuals livingunder one roof that included blood relations and servants. A family influencesvalues and expectations of children that they observe from their parents andinternalize these values and expectations. Parents may teach values andexpectations to their children directly by teaching them and indirectly by example.As many children spend much of their time with their families, families are oftena primary source in the formation of values and expectations that greatly affecttheir development. Child development happens physically, emotionally, socially,and intellectually during early stage of a child's life. To make an analogy, if youwere constructing a large building, you have to make sure that it has a solidfoundation so that the rest of the building can stand tall and strong for many yearsto come.What information from the audio recording is relevant to you as member of thefamily?A.

                            19. Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</h2><br />

                            22. Can someone paraphrase this paragraph in simpler words? Thanks a lot ❤️The Mindfulness-to-meaning Theory (MMT) by Garland, Farb, Goldin and Fredrickson (2015) was planned as a representation of mindful optimistic emotion regulation to fulfill the gap of formalized theory linking mindfulness to more lasting, positive indicators of health. The mindfulness-to-meaning theory (MMT) emphasizes that by altering how an individual attends to the cognitive, affective, and interoceptive abnormalcy of emotion incitement, mindfulness presents flexibility into the formation of autobiographical meaning, stimulating the normal human ability to positively reassess adverse endeavors and value the positive facets of experience. By nurturing positive reassessments and emotions, mindfulness may produce deep eudaimonic meanings that stimulate resilience and commitment with a valued and purposeful existence. The MMT was initially established to justify for the methods in mindfulness training, it might encourage optimistic emotion regulation, and the MMT does not identify the mindfulness meditation, but as an alternative stipulates structures involved in the state and attribute of mindfulness. For that reason, it may define trans-therapeutic procedures involving mindfulness to reconsiderations and positive affect that arise as an outcome of any psychological intermediation adept of stimulating state and attribute of mindfulness.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Mindfulness-to-meaning Theory (MMT) by Garland, Farb, Goldin and Fredrickson (2015) was arranged as a portrayal of careful hopeful feeling guideline to satisfy the hole of formalized hypothesis connecting care to really enduring, good markers of wellbeing. The Mindfulness-to-meaning Theory (MMT) accentuates that by changing how an individual takes care of the intellectual, full of feeling, and interoceptive abnormalcy of feeling induction, care presents adaptability into the arrangement of personal significance, invigorating the typical human capacity to emphatically reevaluate unfriendly undertakings and worth the good aspects of involvement. By sustaining positive reassessments and feelings, care may create profound eudaimonic implications that animate strength and responsibility with an esteemed and deliberate presence. The MMT was at first settled to legitimize for the strategies in care preparing, it may support hopeful feeling guideline, and the MMT doesn't distinguish the care contemplation, however as an option specifies structures associated with the state and property of care. Hence, it might characterize trans-restorative techniques including care to reexaminations and positive influence that emerge as a result of any mental intermediation skilled of invigorating state and trait of mindfulness.​</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps :&gt;</p><br />
