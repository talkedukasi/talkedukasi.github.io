                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer: You asked what the similarities of reviews of related literature and reviews of related studies are.</p><p></p><p>In terms of related literature, you are reviewing literature that other researchers will also use to support their studies in the same field of research as you are doing, but they may be researching on a different research topic from yours.</p><p></p><p>For instance, other researchers’ study topic may be to find out how service providers may best deliver quality hotel service to international tourists from Europe, while you may be researching on a topic relating to how best to deliver quality service to guests in budget hotels.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, since, the research in both cases relate to the delivery of quality service, although one set may be for guests in International hotels, and another set, looking at quality service delivery for guests in Budget hotels. Therefore, in this example, many of the literature which both research groups will be reviewing, will be the same literature - that is, those literature related to the field of service management (Related Literature).</p><p></p><p>However, note that other researchers will be looking at literature more specifically in quality service management for European guests in international hotels, while you are looking at guests at Budget hotels, so clearly, some of the later literature reviewed by you will be associated only from studies relating to Budget hotels (closely related studies - budget hotels).</p><p></p><p>You will ignore literature on studies of quality service delivery at international hotels (Why? It is because this set of literature does not inform you as well on findings pertaining to international hotels).</p><p></p><p>The other researchers will review literature closely associated with international hotels catering for guests from Europe, and will ignore literature associated with quality service delivery for guests Budget hotels (Why? It is because, the set of literature on Budget hotel studies does not inform you on findings pertaining to international hotels).</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
