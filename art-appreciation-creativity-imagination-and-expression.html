                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Imagination</strong>- it is one able to craft something, something new and something better in the hopes of creating something that will stimulate change. </p><p><strong>Expression</strong>- the process of making known one's thoughts or feelings, visual art. It focuses on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Imagination - Art is creative expression that nurtures imagination, and not a lesson in following directions. Through painting, sculpture, collage, clay moulding, drawing or any other medium, art is a way for children to work through emotions, make decisions, and express their ideas.</p><p></p><p>Expression - Painting, coloring, writing, making music, and making crafts are all creative activities. Creative expression helps children articulate their feelings and thoughts. They think critically about their world and practice visual communication. Young children learn colors, shapes, and sounds during creative play.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>^^</p><br />

                            2. art appreciation: creativity, imagination, and expression. discuss briefly.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>Creativity</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>this </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>a manner</strong> <strong>in behavior which you could create things based on how the way you like it with a combination of different things —</strong> In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p. 110), or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of "something original and worthwhile". Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."</p><p></p><p>Creativity in general is usually distinguished from innovation in particular, where the stress is on implementation. For example, Teresa Amabile and Pratt (2016) defines creativity as production of novel and useful ideas and innovation as implementation of creative ideas, while the OECD and Eurostat state that "Innovation is more than a new idea or an invention. An innovation requires implementation, either by being put into active use or by being made available for use by other parties, firms, individuals or organisations."</p><p></p><p>There is also an emotional creativity which is described as a pattern of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to originality and appropriateness in emotional experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>- Imagination can be applied in everything whether in artistical way that you want to make some impossible to possible by constructing and visualizing things in mind and apply it in realistic view -</strong> Imagination is a cognitive process used in mental functioning and sometimes used in conjunction with psychological imagery. It is considered as such because it involves thinking about possibilities. The cognate term of mental imagery may be used in psychology for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "imaging" or "imagery" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary imagination driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and involuntary imagination (LPFC-independent), such as REM-sleep dreaming, daydreaming, hallucinations, and spontaneous insight. The voluntary types of imagination include integration of modifiers, and mental rotation. Imagined images, both novel and recalled, are seen with the "mind's eye".</p><p></p><p>Imagination, however, is not considered to be exclusively a cognitive activity because it is also linked to the body and place, particularly that it also involves setting up relationships with materials and people, precluding the sense that imagination is locked away in the head.</p><p></p><p>Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or fantasies. Children often use such narratives and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations. When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use role playing to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>-Expression can be applied in many things, you can express it on what you do, you can express yourself through artworks, hobbies, crafts and many more. You can present it lively and you can empress it in detailed way that depends on your desires and emotions. </strong></p><br />
