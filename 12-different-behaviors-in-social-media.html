This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture.

(14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior.

This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture.

These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior.
