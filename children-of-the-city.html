(1)_________many of the schools in small towns arelocated a stone's throw away from the pupils' houses, many of schools in thecity are at least a ride away from the pupils' homes. Children need to eat inschool whether in a city or small town so (2)_________pupils in a city also worry about what to give their children as baon for school.(3)_________children in small towns are probably contented with afruit or rice and fish for lunch, children in the city would prefer sweets andchicheria that are readily available in stores near the school. There is also aproblem of safety. Pupils who study in the city need to be always mindful of themany motor vehicles around. (4)________there are also many"vices" that children are exposed to in the city. It is indeed more stressful tostudy in the city, (5)._______I am sure many of those in the smalltowns would grab any opportunity to be able to study here. - Adapted​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story focuses on the events that happen in Victor’s life. At a young age, he loses his father, is left by his mother, and has to work as a newsboy to be able to survive. The central theme of the story- in my opinion- is how the world is unjust and cruel to everyone. There are a few parts wherein Victor finally saw a tether of hope (In the part where he was given two pesos by a sailor), but was quickly robbed of that joy and was replaced with darkness, which lead me to the thought that in reality, there is no mercy held for us. It depicts the realities of millions of people who are suffering, and implies to the readers that the world bows to no one. Another theme of the book is poverty and social injustice, which even in this generation today, still hasn’t been solved. It’s a never-ending cycle of being born poor and dying poor. The story also shows how people in the lower class were and are still taking advantage of (as seen in the strikes of the workers who are fighting for their rights) and how even in their hardest attempts, the people higher than them, or the government, will always find a way to undermine them and put them back in their place (as seen in the part where six-by-six trucks run over the workers).The environment also plays a large role in the theme, since it is the catalyst on how the next parts will happen. How Victor turned out the way he did in the end is because of influence of the outside environment (like the other newsboys and the setting in the streets of Manila).</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Battle of Jericho is an incident from the Book of Joshua, being the first battle fought by the Israelites in the course of the conquest of Canaan. According to Joshua 6:1–27, the walls of Jericho fell after the Israelites marched around the city walls once a day for six days and seven times on the seventh day then blew their trumpets. Excavations at Tell es-Sultan, the biblical Jericho, have failed to substantiate this story,[2] which has its origins in the nationalist propaganda of much later kings of Judah and their claims to the territory of the Kingdom of Israel.[3] The lack of archaeological evidence and the composition, history and theological purposes of the Book of Joshua have led archaeologists like William G. Dever to characterise the story of the fall of Jericho as "invented out of whole cloth".[4]tion:</strong></p>hope it helps<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>They </strong><strong>six </strong><strong>days </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>priest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>carrying </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Ark </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Covenant.</strong></p><br />

                            29. -while-nonetheless-in a similar manner-however-in additionStudying in the big city can be much more stressful than studying in asmall town. (1)_________many of the schools in small towns are located a stone's throw away from the pupils' houses, many of schools in the city are at least a ride away from the pupils' homes. Children need to eat in school whether in a city or small town so (2)_________pupils in a city also worry about what to give their children as baon for school. (3)_________children in small towns are probably contented with afruit or rice and fish for lunch, children in the city would prefer sweets andchicheria that are readily available in stores near the school. There is also aproblem of safety. Pupils who study in the city need to be always mindful of themany motor vehicles around. (4)________there are also many"vices" that children are exposed to in the city. It is indeed more stressful tostudy in the city, (5)._______I am sure many of those in the small towns would grab any opportunity to be able to study here. - Adapted​​</h2><br />
