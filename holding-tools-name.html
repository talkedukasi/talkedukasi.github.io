If you hold up the other end of the plumb line, the line will h straight down, perpendicular to the ground. How can this tool be used to whether a given surface, say the window-sill, is parallel to the floor? 2. Can you name 3 examples of perpendicular and parallel lines that car seen in your- • home ● ● school environment​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><strong>1.</strong> To determine if a surface is parallel to the floor using a plumb line, follow these steps:</p>Hold the plumb line so that the lead bob is hanging freely and the string is taut.Place the end of the plumb line string on one end of the surface you want to test (e.g. the window-sill).Observe whether the lead bob hangs directly over the end of the surface, or if it hangs off to one side.Move the plumb line to the other end of the surface and repeat the observation.If the lead bob hangs directly over both ends of the surface, the surface is parallel to the floor. If the lead bob hangs off to one side at either end, the surface is not parallel to the floor.<p><strong>2.</strong> Examples of perpendicular and parallel lines in a home or school environment:</p>Perpendicular: the corner of a room where two walls meet, the intersection of a bookshelf and the floor, the vertical posts of a bed frame.Parallel: the lines of a notebook paper, the rungs of a ladder, the edges of a door.<br />---------------------------------------<br />Brain!iest, Thank you<br />
