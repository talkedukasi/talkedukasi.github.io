                                            The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.

                            12. The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.

REGION As you have learned earlier, there are different types of text that you will come across. Some of them are academic and technical, some journalistic in style, and some literary. Some examples of technical texts are scientific reports, studies, and business reports. Journalistic texts include straight news or feature articles, while literary texts include the different literary genres commonly found in literature books like poems, essays, stories, plays, and novels, among others.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>However, it is essential to note that academic writing and literary writing are two distinct types of writing.</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is a type of writing that is formal and organized, commonly used in universities, colleges, and scholarly publications. Academic writing focuses on presenting ideas and research in a clear, concise, and logical way, while providing credible sources to support arguments. This type of writing is usually objective, and facts are presented in a way that is free from personal opinions or biases. Examples of academic writing include research papers, theses, dissertations, and academic articles.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, literary writing is a type of writing that is artistic and creative in nature and often explores topics such as human experiences, emotions, and relationships. Literary writing aims to engage readers emotionally and intellectually, using figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey meaning. Examples of literary writing include novels, poetry, plays, and essays.</p><p></p><p>Through examining various examples of text types, you will be able to classify them based on their characteristics and understand the difference between academic and literary writing. This will help you recognize the specific purpose and intended audience of different writing styles, therefore improving your overall understanding of various types of writing.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the distinction between academic and literary writing is crucial in developing your writing skills. By being able to differentiate between the two, you can determine the appropriate writing style to use for specific tasks, which can help you meet the expectations of your audiences effectively.</p><p></p><br />
