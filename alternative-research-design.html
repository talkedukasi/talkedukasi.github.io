Step 2: Research topic area Go to the library and read up on information related to the problem you identified. Review existing records or data. Consult experts who have worked on a similar problem. If your problem affects a particular community, you can interview officials or authorities who have jurisdiction over the area. Step 3: Hypothesize Formulate an educated guess on the factors that affect your particular problem. There are two types of hypothesis: the null and alternative. The null hypothesis (H) is written in the negative form. The alternative hypothesis (H) in the affirmative form Step 4: Test design your experiment and write the step-by-step procedure that you will use to test your hypothesis. Gather the materials that you will need. Identify the treatment that you will implement so that you can compare the results with a reference data. Observe and record what happens when one variable is manipulated or changed. Step 5: Analyze data organize your data into tables and graphs so that it will be easier to visualize your results. Summarize the data presented in your charts and tables. Step 6: Conclude based on your findings and interpretation of the data, draw your conclusions and see if they agree with your hypothesis. if the conclusion supports the hypothesis, then accept your hypothesis and recommend other components for further investigation. Share the difficulties you have encountered in the course of your study, what you will do differently and how. If the conclusion refutes the hypothesis, then reject the hypothesis, accept its counterhypothesis, and then recommend other ways of solving your problem.​</a>

As an alternative to mailing thequestionnaire, it is possible to hand them outdirectly to your potential respondents in yourchosen sampling frame4. All mailed questionnaires should beaccompanied by a covering letter and includea stamped, addressed envelope.5 Questionnaires are a useful option toconsider when conducting a postal survey6. Surveys are a modern way of conductingresearch7.

                                            Refer to the lecture in the summary and decide which research design is appropriate for your study?Summary:A method is a technique which the researcher uses to gather and generate data about the subjects of their study. Whilemethodology is the section of the research paper which explains why the researcher chose to use particular methods. The methodology also includes descriptions of any and all theoretical and/or ideological concepts informing and influencing the course of the study, and the researcher’s rationale behind adhering to these concepts. A research design is a plan which structures a study to ensure that the data collected and generated will contain the information needed to answer the initial inquiry as fully and clearly as possible. According to University of California (2017) as cited by Samosa (nd) the function of a research design is to ensure that the evidence obtained enables you to effectively address the research problem logically and as unambiguously as possible. The length and complexity of describing research designs in your paper can vary considerably, but any well-developed design will achieve all of the following:1. Identify the research problem clearly and justify its selection, particularly in relation to any valid alternative designs that could have been used.2. Review and synthesize previously published literature associated with the research problem.3. Clearly and explicitly specify hypotheses [i.e., research questions] central to the problem.4. Effectively describe the data which will be necessary for an adequate testing of the hypotheses and explain how such data will be obtained.5. Describe the methods of analysis to be applied to the data in determining whether or not the hypotheses are true or false.patulong Po:((​</a>

A researcher wants to determine the effect of different concentrations of marigold extract on egg yolk color samples. He expects that the higher the concentration of marigold extract fed to chickens, the brighter the color of the egg yolk would be. To test this hypothesis, 13 chickens of the same age and health condition were fed daily with polished rice mixed with varied concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of marigold extract within 45 days. To achieve the concentration, marigold extracts were diluted in distilled water. Three chickens were used for each concentration. The last chicken was fed with polished rice only. All chickens were placed under the same conditions of temperature and amount of light. After the said experiment, the chickens laid eggs and the color of their yolks were compared.

Step 2: Research topic area Go to the library and read up on information related to the problem you identified. Review existing records or data. Consult experts who have worked on a similar problem. If your problem affects a particular community, you can interview officials or authorities who have jurisdiction over the area. Step 3: Hypothesize Formulate an educated guess on the factors that affect your particular problem. There are two types of hypothesis: the null and alternative. The null hypothesis (H) is written in the negative form. The alternative hypothesis (H) in the affirmative form Step 4: Test design your experiment and write the step-by-step procedure that you will use to test your hypothesis. Gather the materials that you will need. Identify the treatment that you will implement so that you can compare the results with a reference data. Observe and record what happens when one variable is manipulated or changed. Step 5: Analyze data organize your data into tables and graphs so that it will be easier to visualize your results. Summarize the data presented in your charts and tables. Step 6: Conclude based on your findings and interpretation of the data, draw your conclusions and see if they agree with your hypothesis. if the conclusion supports the hypothesis, then accept your hypothesis and recommend other components for further investigation. Share the difficulties you have encountered in the course of your study, what you will do differently and how. If the conclusion refutes the hypothesis, then reject the hypothesis, accept its counterhypothesis, and then recommend other ways of solving your problem.​</h2><br />

Whilemethodology is the section of the research paper which explains why the researcher chose to use particular methods. The methodology also includes descriptions of any and all theoretical and/or ideological concepts informing and influencing the course of the study, and the researcher’s rationale behind adhering to these concepts. A research design is a plan which structures a study to ensure that the data collected and generated will contain the information needed to answer the initial inquiry as fully and clearly as possible. According to University of California (2017) as cited by Samosa (nd) the function of a research design is to ensure that the evidence obtained enables you to effectively address the research problem logically and as unambiguously as possible. The length and complexity of describing research designs in your paper can vary considerably, but any well-developed design will achieve all of the following:1. Identify the research problem clearly and justify its selection, particularly in relation to any valid alternative designs that could have been used.2. Review and synthesize previously published literature associated with the research problem.3. Clearly and explicitly specify hypotheses [i.e., research questions] central to the problem.4.

A researcher wants to determine the effect of different concentrations of marigold extract on egg yolk color samples. He expects that the higher the concentration of marigold extract fed to chickens, the brighter the color of the egg yolk would be. To test this hypothesis, 13 chickens of the same age and health condition were fed daily with polished rice mixed with varied concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of marigold extract within 45 days. To achieve the concentration, marigold extracts were diluted in distilled water. Three chickens were used for each concentration. The last chicken was fed with polished rice only. All chickens were placed under the same conditions of temperature and amount of light. After the said experiment, the chickens laid eggs and the color of their yolks were compared.

Research hypothesis is also known as scientific hypothesis.2. A hypothesis is the same as proposition.3. A hypothesis has to be developed at the upfront of every research.4. A hypothesis is an educated guess.5. In conclusive research designs, hypothesis emerges at the research findings stage.6. The null hypothesis is the statement originally proposed by the researcher as the suggested answer to the research question.7. A simple hypothesis is formulated when predicting relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. 8. Assumptions are propositions taken to be true based upon the presupposition without preponderance of the facts.9. Null hypothesis is subjected to testing in which the decision is either to accept or reject it.10. Hypothesis should be complex.11. Hypothesis should be general.12. There are mainly two possible decision scenarios in hypothesis testing.13. Three possible decision scenarios can take place in making hypothesis testing decisions.14. Hypothesis should be testable.15. A hypothesis is a tentative prediction about the relationship between two or more variables in a population under study.Additional ActivityInstructions: Write Ho on the line if the statement is a null hypothesis; Ha, if it is an alternative hypothesis; and X if it is not a hypothesis.
