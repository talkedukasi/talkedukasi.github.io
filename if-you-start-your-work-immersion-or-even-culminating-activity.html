Discuss the key difference between In-school or Home-based and Community-based or Industry Work Immersion.3. Now that Industry Work Immersion is not yet possible, how can you help yourself and your teachers make the Home-based and In-School Work Immersion successful?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Work immersion is important for Senior High School (SHS) students because it provides them with an opportunity to apply and develop the knowledge and skills they have learned in the classroom to real-world situations. Work immersion programs help students gain hands-on experience and insights into the actual workings of the industry or profession they plan to pursue, making them more competitive and better prepared for their future careers.</p><p></p><p>2. The key difference between in-school or home-based work immersion and community-based or industry work immersion lies in the location and nature of the work experience. In-school or home-based work immersion programs are typically conducted within the school premises or in a simulated workplace environment, and they focus on developing foundational knowledge and skills that are relevant to a specific industry or profession. On the other hand, community-based or industry work immersion programs involve actual work experience in a real-world workplace setting, where students can observe and participate in actual job tasks and gain practical skills and experience.</p><p></p><p>3. To make the home-based and in-school work immersion successful, students can:</p><p></p>Take the initiative to research and learn more about the industry or profession they are interested in.Actively participate in classroom discussions and activities related to work immersion.Seek feedback from their teachers and supervisors to improve their performance and skills.Practice good communication and interpersonal skills to build positive relationships with colleagues and supervisors.Follow safety protocols and regulations to ensure a safe and healthy work environment.Be open to learning and trying new things, and take advantage of opportunities to gain additional experience and knowledge in their field.<p>Teachers, on the other hand, can help make the home-based and in-school work immersion successful by:</p><p></p>Providing students with clear instructions and expectations for the work immersion program.Facilitating discussions and activities that help students connect classroom learning to real-world scenarios.Monitoring and providing feedback on student progress and performance.Creating a positive and supportive learning environment that encourages active participation and learning.<p></p><p>Collaborating with industry partners or professionals to provide students with relevant and up-to-date information and insights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whether it’s forming a study group for one of your classes or joining club or organization in your field of study, putting yourself in situations that force you to work with others will help you become more comfortable.

From the first day of our existence to the last, we are constantly learning, growing, and evolving. Every experience, whether big or small, presents an opportunity for learning and personal growth.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important lessons we can learn is to embrace change and adapt to new situations. Life is unpredictable, and we must learn to be flexible and adjust to new circumstances. This can be challenging, but it is essential for our personal growth and development.</p><p></p><p>Another important insight is that learning requires effort and perseverance. We must be willing to put in the time and energy necessary to acquire new knowledge and skills. This may involve stepping out of our comfort zones and taking risks, but the rewards can be great.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it is important to recognize that learning is not always easy or straightforward. We may encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way, but these can be valuable opportunities for learning and growth. By persevering through difficult times and learning from our mistakes, we can become better equipped to handle future challenges.</p><p></p><p>In addition, it is essential to maintain a positive attitude towards learning. This means approaching new experiences with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others. It also means being patient with ourselves and acknowledging that we may not get everything right the first time. By fostering a growth mindset and embracing a love of learning, we can continue to grow and develop throughout our lives.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is important to remember that we are all unique individuals with our own strengths and weaknesses. We should celebrate our successes and acknowledge our areas for improvement. By focusing on our strengths and working to develop our weaknesses, we can become the best version of ourselves.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the journey of learning and personal growth is a lifelong process that requires effort, perseverance, and an open mind.

The most interesting thing I learned is how different art forms reflect the stories and beliefs of our ancestors.</p><p></p><p>During my work, I have acquired knowledge of various art forms such as music, dance, theater, and fine arts. I also learned about the different terms and concepts related to these art forms, such as kulintang, gamelan, sarswela, and komedya.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges I experienced during the climactic activity was time management. The assignment required a lot of research and preparation, and I had to balance it with my other academic duties. In order to improve next time, I can start preparing earlier and plan my time better.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the culminating activity of Ani ng Sining was a satisfying and informative experience.

                            30. How do you want your to flow your culminating activity plan?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A culminating event is when students share the product or result of their investigation, receive feedback, and celebrate their learning. Students are actively involved in the planning of the culmination. They decide what to make, how to present the information and who to invite. Instead of taking a test that asks them to recall information, they are synthesizing ideas and building on what they’ve learned to create something new. Students demonstrate their learning with either a product, performance or presentation. Allowing the students to choose how and what they will present, gives teachers the opportunity to asses the learning preferences of their students as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Learn </strong><strong>more </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>brainly </strong><strong>app</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Paki </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>at </strong><strong>paki </strong><strong>follow</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>sorry </strong><strong>kung </strong><strong>mataas </strong><strong>yan </strong><strong>lang </strong><strong>naalam </strong><strong>ko </strong><strong>e</strong></p><br />
