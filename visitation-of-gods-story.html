Bathala was the caretaker of the earth, Ulilang kaluluwa (lit Orphaned Spirit), a huge serpent who lived in the clouds, and Galang kaluluwa (lit Wandering spirit), the winged god who loves to travel. These three gods did not know each other. Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met. Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased. He challenged Bathala to a fight to decide who would be the ruler of the universe. After three days and three nights, Ulilang kaluluwa was slain by Bathala. PROBLEM SOLUTION​</a>

Daedalus, having observed the flight of birds and received many visits from his avlan friends, devised a plan. Through wax and feather . Daedalus fashioned two pats of wings. Finally on the day of the escape. Daedalus wamed his son not to Hy too high near the sun, for the heat of the sun could easily melt the wax of the wings. However, upon escaping, Icarus soars up into the sky from gladiness. Poor Daedalus could only watch as his son dropped into the sea, wingless. 1. Setting:_________ 2. Characters:__________ 3.

                                            How does these stories illustrate the element of trust found in faith? Some English botanists once visited Switzerland to collect rare mountain flowers. Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below.

As he dropped into a chair, he used a native word meaning, "I am resting my full weight here." Instantly, Dr. Paton grasped this word as the one he needed for "faith." To "rest my full weight" upon something is to fully believe and trust - to have faith - that it will support me.

Bathala was the caretaker of the earth, Ulilang kaluluwa (lit. Orphaned Spirit), a huge serpent who lived in the clouds, and Galang kaluluwa (lit. Wandering spirit), the winged god who loves to travel. These three gods did not know each other. Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased.

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

                                             According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted

This time, we will a read story that will excite our souls and our imagination about Bathala and the story of Creation. Come on! BATHALA: The Story of CreationIn the beginning of time there were three powerful gods who lived in the universe. Bathala was the caretaker of the earth, Ulilang kaluluwa (lit. Orphaned Spirit), a huge serpent who lived in the clouds, and Galang kaluluwa (Lit. Wandering spirit), the winged god who loves to travel. These three gods did not know each other.Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met. Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased. He challenged Bathala to a fight to decide who would be the ruler of the universe. After three days and three nights, Ulilang kaluluwa was slain by Bathala.1.) Who are the characters in the story?

                                            can someone answer this?The Story of ZacchaeusOne day Jesus traveled through a town named Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?”God smiles and says, “That was the screen saver.”​</a>

                                            Please help me answer this question this has a story here is the storyA new life of saulThere was a man name Saul who hated the followers of Jesus and wanted to kill them. One day, he asked permission from the chief priest to arrest Jesus' followers. Upon getting the permission, Saul proceeded to Damascus where many of Jesus' followers can be found. On his way, he saw a bright light, causing him to fall from his horse. Then head a voice asking him, "Saul, Saul, why are you hurting Me so much?" Saul asked, "Who are you?" Then, the voice answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth." The voice also told Saul to stand up and go to Damascus. But when Saul opened his eyes, he found out that he was blind. The men who were with him who heard the voice, too, brought Saul to Damascus.in Damascus, God instructed a disciple named Ananias to visit Saul. Ananiasimmediately went and upon seeing Saul, laid his hands on him. He told Saul that Jesus has sent him that he may regain his sight and receive the Holy Spirit. At once, Saul was able to see e again. Then, Saul got up and had himself baptized by Ananias. Saul stayed for a few days in Damascus and together with some disciples, hebegan to proclaim Jesus as the "Son of God." All who heard him were surprised for they knew that he was the man who wanted to arrest those who believe in Jesus. But Saul grew even stronger and proclaimed even more convincingly to the Jaws that indeed, "Jesus is the Messiah." dre Toleprepare Saul shows us how we should prepare for Jesus' gift of a new life. He obeys Jesus when He tells him to go to Damascus and stay there. Saul stops persecuting the followers of Jesus and allows Ananias baptize him. After receiving the gift of new life from Jesus, Saul starts proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God. Those who know him cannot believe that he is now doing what he wanted the followers of Jesus to stop doing Clearly, when Saul accepts Jesus Saul invitation for him to lead a new life, it produces many challenges in him, the greatest of which was his decision to proclaim by his words and actions that Jesus is the Messiah.We, too, are called to do the same. Just as we make the necessary preparations for changes in our lives, we also must prepare for the new life that Jesus offers to eachone of us.Like Saul, we must also stop committing sins and starts a life that is faithful to God. Our acceptance of Jesus' invitation to a new life should lead us to show others who Jesus is and what He has done out of love for us.​</a>

Bathala was the caretaker of the earth, Ulilang kaluluwa (lit Orphaned Spirit), a huge serpent who lived in the clouds, and Galang kaluluwa (lit Wandering spirit), the winged god who loves to travel. These three gods did not know each other. Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met. Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased. He challenged Bathala to a fight to decide who would be the ruler of the universe. After three days and three nights, Ulilang kaluluwa was slain by Bathala. PROBLEM SOLUTION​</h2><br />

Daedalus and Icarus Daedalus an Athenkan inventor, architect, and sculptor, was banished and escaped to Crete following the deliberate murder of his apprentice Perdix out of leclousy. In Crete. he was recruited by the epurt of King Minos. Among the many services he provided for the king, the most famous task was the building at a labyrinth. The labyrinth was first conceived to confine the monstrous Minotaur, a part-man part-bull creature created due to Minos own Ingratitude towards the God of the Seas, Poseidon King Minas was fearful that the talents al Daedalus would escape his court Moreover, following an incident involving Theseus and the Minotaur, Daedalus fell out of favor with the King, and subsequently, was locked up. However, the king knew that Daedalus would have his own methods of escaping his own architectural masterpiece, so the exit of the labyrinth was heavily guarded and Daedalus, along with his son was tocked in a place of higher altitude, In the small room of confinement, there was a window. Daedalus, having observed the flight of birds and received many visits from his avlan friends, devised a plan. Through wax and feather . Daedalus fashioned two pats of wings. Finally on the day of the escape. Daedalus wamed his son not to Hy too high near the sun, for the heat of the sun could easily melt the wax of the wings. However, upon escaping, Icarus soars up into the sky from gladiness. Poor Daedalus could only watch as his son dropped into the sea, wingless. 1. Setting:_________ 2. Characters:__________ 3.

                            11. How does these stories illustrate the element of trust found in faith? Some English botanists once visited Switzerland to collect rare mountain flowers. Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below. The botanists turned to a young boy who had been watching them and said, "Boy, let us tie a rope around your waist and lower you to the ledge below. After digging up two plants, we will pull you up again. We will pay you for your trouble." The boy answered, "I will do it." However, he ran down the mountain to the valley below. Soon he returned with a man. "Sirs," he stated, "this is my father. If you will let him hold the rope, I will go down and get the plants for you." When Dr. John Paton was translating the New Testament into the language of the South Sea Islanders, he could not find a native word for "faith." One day as he was working in his study, one of the natives came in, hot and tired from a long, strenuous walk. As he dropped into a chair, he used a native word meaning, "I am resting my full weight here." Instantly, Dr. Paton grasped this word as the one he needed for "faith." To "rest my full weight" upon something is to fully believe and trust - to have faith - that it will support me. Now as we can observe in the Scripture, it does not always speak of faith in God and His Word in the​</h2><br />

</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>When writers write to explain, they want to tell the reader how to do something or reveal to them how something works. This type of writing is about communicating a method or a process.</p><p></p><p><strong>PERSUADE</strong>
</p><p>This is a very common purpose of writing, particularly in nonfiction writing. When a text is written to persuade it will aim to convince the reader of the merits of a certain point of view. With this type of writing the author will attempt to persuade the reader to agree with this point of view and/or subsequently take a particular course of action. </p><p></p><p><strong>INFORM</strong>
</p><p> When an author’s purpose is to inform, they usually wish to enlighten their readership about a real-world topic. Often, they will do this by providing lots of facts. Informational texts are geared toward imparting information to the reader with the purpose of educating them on a given topic. </p><p></p><p> <strong>ENTERTAIN</strong>
</p><p> When an author’s chief purpose is to entertain the reader they will endeavour to keep things as interesting as possible. Things happen in books that are written to entertain, whether in the form of an action-packed plot, inventive characterizations, or sharp dialogue.</p><p></p><p><strong>DESCRIBE</strong>
</p><p> Often writers will use words to describe something in more detail than be conveyed in a photograph alone. After all, they say ‘a picture paints a thousand words and text can help get us beyond the one-dimensional appearance of things.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />

Wandering spirit), the winged god who loves to travel. These three gods did not know each other. Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased.

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

                            23.  According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted

These three gods did not know each other.Bathala often dreamt of creating mortals but the empty earth stops him from doing so. Ulilang kaluluwa who was equally lonely as Bathala, liked to visit places and the earth was his favorite. One day the two gods met. Ulilang kaluluwa, seeing another god rivaling him, was not pleased.

A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

He is known primarily for his faith in climbing a sycamore tree to see Jesus, and also his generosity in giving half of all he possessed. A descendant of Abraham, he was an example of Jesus's personal, earthly mission to bring salvation to the lost.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus was a tax collector who lived in Jericho. Many people hated Zacchaeus, not only because he was rich and powerful, but also because they thought that he was a sinner because of his job. Zacchaeus heard that Jesus was coming to visit Jericho, and wanted to see him.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Jesus looked up and said, “Hurry down, Zacchaeus, because I must stay in your house today.” The people started grumbling because Jesus was going to the home of a sinner. However, Zacchaeus promised to give half his belongings to the poor and pay back four times as much to anyone he had cheated.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus showed he was willing to change by offering half of his belongings to the poor and paying back four times as much to anyone he had cheated. This amount was what the Old Testament law demanded as a repayment for dishonesty.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Honesty is the foundation for trust in a relationship, and trust is necessary for a relationship to function and thrive. When you're always honest with someone, it tells them that they can trust you and the things you say. It helps them know they can believe your promises and commitments</strong><strong>.</strong></p><br />

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?”God smiles and says, “That was the screen saver.”​</h2><br />

                            28. Please help me answer this question this has a story here is the storyA new life of saulThere was a man name Saul who hated the followers of Jesus and wanted to kill them. One day, he asked permission from the chief priest to arrest Jesus' followers. Upon getting the permission, Saul proceeded to Damascus where many of Jesus' followers can be found. On his way, he saw a bright light, causing him to fall from his horse. Then head a voice asking him, "Saul, Saul, why are you hurting Me so much?" Saul asked, "Who are you?" Then, the voice answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth." The voice also told Saul to stand up and go to Damascus. But when Saul opened his eyes, he found out that he was blind. The men who were with him who heard the voice, too, brought Saul to Damascus.in Damascus, God instructed a disciple named Ananias to visit Saul. Ananiasimmediately went and upon seeing Saul, laid his hands on him. He told Saul that Jesus has sent him that he may regain his sight and receive the Holy Spirit. At once, Saul was able to see e again. Then, Saul got up and had himself baptized by Ananias. Saul stayed for a few days in Damascus and together with some disciples, hebegan to proclaim Jesus as the "Son of God." All who heard him were surprised for they knew that he was the man who wanted to arrest those who believe in Jesus. But Saul grew even stronger and proclaimed even more convincingly to the Jaws that indeed, "Jesus is the Messiah." dre Toleprepare Saul shows us how we should prepare for Jesus' gift of a new life. He obeys Jesus when He tells him to go to Damascus and stay there. Saul stops persecuting the followers of Jesus and allows Ananias baptize him. After receiving the gift of new life from Jesus, Saul starts proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God. Those who know him cannot believe that he is now doing what he wanted the followers of Jesus to stop doing Clearly, when Saul accepts Jesus Saul invitation for him to lead a new life, it produces many challenges in him, the greatest of which was his decision to proclaim by his words and actions that Jesus is the Messiah.We, too, are called to do the same. Just as we make the necessary preparations for changes in our lives, we also must prepare for the new life that Jesus offers to eachone of us.Like Saul, we must also stop committing sins and starts a life that is faithful to God. Our acceptance of Jesus' invitation to a new life should lead us to show others who Jesus is and what He has done out of love for us.​</h2><br />
