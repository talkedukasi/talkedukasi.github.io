Use a separate sheet of paper. Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

THE CROW AND THE PITCHER in a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst. Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink -Taken from https://www.shortkidstories.com/ storylaesopsfables/#THE CROW_AND_THE_PITCHER patience determination resourceful hardworking​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180° and 100°E in the Northern Hemisphere. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin,[1] and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E). The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.[2]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paki brainliest Po please</p><br />

Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />

                            10. Let's Apply Read the story. Using the concept map given write a descriptive paragraph about the characters. THE CROW AND THE PITCHER in a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst. Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink -Taken from https://www.shortkidstories.com/ storylaesopsfables/#THE CROW_AND_THE_PITCHER patience determination resourceful hardworking​</h2><br />
