But also how it functions to allow survival and reproduction.<strong>Archaeological anthropology, Archaeology is similar to anthropology in that it focuses on understanding human culture from the deepest history up until the recent past. </strong>It differs from anthropology in that it focuses specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifact and architectural remnants.<strong>Linguistic anthropology, Linguistic anthropology studies the nature of human languages in the context of those cultures that developed them. </strong>Scholars in the field seek to understand the social and cultural foundations of language itself, while exploring how social and cultural formations are grounded in linguistic practices.<strong>Applied Anthropology, </strong> Is the branch of antropology who sometimes called the "fifth sub-field"<strong>, applied anthropology is simply defined as the use of anthropological knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems.</strong><p></p><p><strong>So the correct pair of answers for the statement from branches of anthropology above is :</strong></p><strong>Sociocultural Anthropology</strong><strong>Archeological Anthropology</strong><strong>Applied Anthropology</strong><strong>Linguistic Anthropology </strong><strong>Physical or Biological Anthropology</strong><strong>Socio cultural Anthropology</strong><p></p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p><strong>What is an Anthropology https://brainly.ph/question/2191579</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hermeneutic phenomenology is a qualitative research methodology. It is closely related to phenomenological philosophy. Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation. Textual meaning, preunderstanding, tradition, dialogue and interpretation are the basic themes of hermeneutic phenomenology. The foremost representatives of this movement are Heidegger, Ricoeur, and Gadamer.
</p><p>
</p><p>The advantages of using phenomenology for research are:
</p><p>
</p><p>It helps to gain an in-depth understanding of individual phenomena.
</p><p>
</p><p>It provides rich data from the experiences of the individuals.
</p><p>
</p><p>The disadvantages are:
</p><p>
</p><p>The data is subjective and it is difficult to establish the validity of the information.
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be researcher induced bias.
</p><p>
</p><p>The interpretation of the data may be difficult.
</p><p>
</p><p>The qualitative results may not be presented in a way which is usable by the practitioners.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Psychoanalysis:a system of psychological theory and therapy which aims to treat mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the mind and bringing repressed fears and conflicts into the conscious mind by techniques such as dream interpretation and free association.</p><p></p><p>Feminist Theory:Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, fictional, or philosophical discourse. It aims to understand the nature of gender inequality. It examines women's and men's social roles, experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as anthropology and sociology, communication, media studies, psychoanalysis, ecology, home economics, literature, education, and philosophy.</p><p></p><p>Phenomenology: (from Greek φαινόμενον, phainómenon "that which appears" and λόγος, lógos "study") is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.</p><p></p><p>Rational Choice: According to the definition of rational choice theory , every choice that is made is completed by first considering the costs, risks and benefits of making that decision. Choices that seem irrational to one person may make perfect sense to another based on the individual's desires.</p><p></p><p>Human-Environment Systems: A coupled human–environment system characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems and natural systems. This coupling expresses the idea that the evolution of humans and environmental systems may no longer be treated as individual isolated systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
