                            12. 1. Write T if the statement is TRUE and F if the statement is FALSE. 1. A typhoon, which is also called a tropical cyclone, usually develops in a tropical region. It develops over the warm water in oceans and uses it as an energy source.2. While calm winds spiral within the eyewall, wind in the eye itself is strong and violent. 3. A typhoon maintains its strength as it stays above warm. Staying above the warm ocean water and with continuing favorable conditions for its build-up, a typhoon can grow bigger and more powerful. 4. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is the main forecast center assigned to monitor all weather disturbances. 5. Public Storm Warning Signal No. 1 is raised when winds move at a speed of 61-120 kph and may be expected in at least 24 hours. 6. Classes in the elementary are suspended when typhoon signal number 1 is raised. 7. Public Storm Warning Signal No. 3 is raised when winds move at a speed of 121- 170 kph and may be expected in at least 18 hours. 8. Public Storm Warning Signal No. 5 means a super typhoon will affect the locality and winds moving at a speed of 220 kph or above may be expected in at least 12 hours. 9. A thunderstorm is the rarest type of weather disturbance that is experienced in the Philippines. 10. The two monsoons are Northeast monsoon or amihan -felt during the month of June and October and the southwest monsoon or habagat -experienced from November to February.IF CORRECT BRAINLIEST AND 50 POINTSANDNONSENSE REPORT​​</h2><br />

                            25. ENGLISH 5 - DAY 2 - March 07, 2023 Writing is done for a number of different purposes and for different audiences. These different forms of writing are often known as text types. These are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. Features depend on the purpose of the text. Some of it commonly use signal words for better understanding of the text. Text-type purpose includes enumeration, classification, time-order and explanation. ACTIVITY 1 DIRECTIONS: Complete the table below using what you have learned on the text-types.

You might do this when you wish to list the issues you wish to address in your text. Or to give list of reasons or causes. </p><p>2. Classification-Organized Ideas by groups or types-categorizing text into one or more different classes to organize, structure, and filter into any parameter. </p><p>3. Explanation-Text that explains-Makes something more clear-it might tell you how or why something happens, or give information on how to do something.</p><p>4.

                            26.  Identify the Implicit Signal being defined. Write your answer on the space provided before the number. 1. These are also known as parallelism wherein similar grammatical constructions are use between words in sentences, particularly for words in lists. 2. These are signposts that guide and tell the reader what is coming up ahead and where the discussion is going. 3. These are words that have essentially the same meaning, and they provide some variety in your word choices, helping you, the reader, to stay focused on the idea being discussed. 4. This implicit signal helps you to focus and keep track on what you are reading 5. These are words used in referring back to something previously mentioned.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Between each word, coherence can be created by parallelism. Parallel structure means using similar grammatical constructions between words in sentences. Parallelism is particularly important for words in lists. If you're writing a list of things someone likes to do, then each activity in the list should take the same grammatical form. For instance, if one verb in the list takes on the '-ing' gerund form, like 'running,' then the other verbs in the list should also be in the gerund form. An incoherent structure would be to say:</p><p></p><p>Sarah likes to jump, running, and skate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the list should be parallel like this:</p><p></p><p>Sarah likes jumping, running, and skating.</p><p></p><p>Coherence Between Sentences</p><p>Coherence can be created between sentences through repetition and transitional devices. Repetition of words across sentences helps to reiterate the same ideas between sentences. One way to use repetition to create coherence is to repeat the same word or phrase at the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next sentence to show how the ideas connect. Here is an example of sentences that create coherence through repetition:</p><p></p><p>The most important part of an essay is the thesis statement. The thesis statement introduces the argument of the essay. The thesis statement also helps to create a structure for the essay.</p><p></p><p>In this example, the repetition of the phrase 'thesis statement' helps to unify the three sentences. It is a phrase that ends the first sentence and transitions into the next sentence by starting with that same phrase.</p><p></p><p>Another way to create coherence between sentences is through transitional devices. There are many types of transitional devices that show time and help ideas flow smoothly. Transitional words, such as 'first', 'later', and 'then', are a few examples of transitional devices that show time to help ideas flow more smoothly. Transitional devices are like signposts that tell the reader what is coming up ahead and where the discussion is going.</p><p></p><p>Coherence Between Paragraphs</p><p>Transitional words can also be used between paragraphs. Words such as:</p><p></p><p>Therefore</p><p>However</p><p>Yet</p><p>Thus</p><p>First</p><p>Later</p><p>Then</p><p>can not only be used between sentences, but between paragraphs to connect them. Other ways to create coherence between paragraphs include having a consistent paragraph structure and point of view.</p><p></p><p>The structure of a coherent paragraph includes a topic sentence, which focuses on the main idea. The topic sentence usually comes first in a paragraph. The topic sentence is followed by supporting sentences that develop the idea, and finally, a concluding sentence to tie it all together. Transitional words then bridge the gap between paragraphs, and the structure starts anew with another topic sentence for the next paragraph.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(Hope it helped tho!) </p><br />
