                                            CaseConstanciandra Lopez and Soleil Cervantes were classmates in high school. After hurdling the high school course, Soleil enrolled in a college course at Santa Arcadia University and finished the course in due time. She applied for a job in a hotel as HR Assistant, and was hired. After four years of good work, she was given the job of head of the Human Resource Department.Within three months as head of the HRD, she was visited by her classmate in high school (Ciandra) and was asked for assistance in finding a job. She felt sad when Ciandra informed her that she was not fortunate to go to college. Soleil, however, was determined to help her former classmate.It was during that month that finding qualified applicants to fill vacancies in the housekeeping department was quite difficult. Most of the attendants were already working overtime. When Soleil reported for work early in the morning, she found her desk a request by one public area attendant for a three-month leave on account of illness. Soleil began to feel uncomfortable because she sees a possible crisis in the hotel’s manpower supply.The urgency of the situation brought Soleil to think of giving Ciandra a chance to work as a substitute for the public area attendant.On the first day of work, Ciandra barely finished her cleaning before quitting time. It looks as through Ciandra is not used to doing manual jobs, as she appeared so tired. On the second day, an elderly couple stumbled upon a pail of water Ciandra placed in a corner of the pathway. It becomes clear, later, that Ciandra did not follow the safety procedure in cleaning the public area assigned to her.The assistant housekeeper assigned to supervise Ciandra immediately informed Soleil of Ciandra’s performance. Soleil realized quickly that she made a mistake in allowing Ciandra to start working as a public area attendant. Now, she is in deep thought on how she should go about averting the mini-crisis at hand.Question:What did Soleil and the assistant housekeeper fail to do? What should they do now?​</a>

                            26. CaseConstanciandra Lopez and Soleil Cervantes were classmates in high school. After hurdling the high school course, Soleil enrolled in a college course at Santa Arcadia University and finished the course in due time. She applied for a job in a hotel as HR Assistant, and was hired. After four years of good work, she was given the job of head of the Human Resource Department.Within three months as head of the HRD, she was visited by her classmate in high school (Ciandra) and was asked for assistance in finding a job. She felt sad when Ciandra informed her that she was not fortunate to go to college. Soleil, however, was determined to help her former classmate.It was during that month that finding qualified applicants to fill vacancies in the housekeeping department was quite difficult. Most of the attendants were already working overtime. When Soleil reported for work early in the morning, she found her desk a request by one public area attendant for a three-month leave on account of illness. Soleil began to feel uncomfortable because she sees a possible crisis in the hotel’s manpower supply.The urgency of the situation brought Soleil to think of giving Ciandra a chance to work as a substitute for the public area attendant.On the first day of work, Ciandra barely finished her cleaning before quitting time. It looks as through Ciandra is not used to doing manual jobs, as she appeared so tired. On the second day, an elderly couple stumbled upon a pail of water Ciandra placed in a corner of the pathway. It becomes clear, later, that Ciandra did not follow the safety procedure in cleaning the public area assigned to her.The assistant housekeeper assigned to supervise Ciandra immediately informed Soleil of Ciandra’s performance. Soleil realized quickly that she made a mistake in allowing Ciandra to start working as a public area attendant. Now, she is in deep thought on how she should go about averting the mini-crisis at hand.Question:What did Soleil and the assistant housekeeper fail to do? What should they do now?​</h2><br />
