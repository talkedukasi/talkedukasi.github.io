Source: 5-A U.S. ARMY AND MARINE CORPS BATTLEFIELD LOGISTICS by Alan Dennis.
Shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 (Desert Storm), the U.S. Department of Defense realized that there were significant problems in its battlefield logistics systems that provided supplies to the troops at the division level and below. During the Gulf War, it had proved difficult for army and marine units fighting together to share supplies back and forth because their logistics computer systems would not easily communicate. The goal of the new system was to combine the army and marine corps logistics systems into one system to enable units to share supplies under battlefield conditions.The army and marines built separate as-is process models of their existing logistics systems that had 165 processes for the army system and 76 processes for the marines. Both process models were developed over a 3-month time period and cost several million dollars to build, even though they were not intended to be comprehensive.I helped them develop a model for the new integrated battlefield logistics system that would be used by both services (i.e., the to-be model). The initial process model contained 1,500 processes and went down to level 6 DFDs in many places. It took 3,300 pages to print. They realized that this model was too large to be useful. The project leader decided that level 4 DFDs was as far as the model would go, with additional information contained in the process descriptions. This reduced the model to 375 processes (800 pages) and made it far more useful.
Questions
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages to setting a limit for the maximum depth for a DFD?
2. Is a level 4 DFD an appropriate limit? Why? Why not?</a>

                                            PRE-TESTDirections: Read the paragraph below. Choose the letter of the correct answer. Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.

For example in a reading comprehension learners use their knowledge of the genre to predict what will be in the text (top down), and their understanding of affixation to guess meaning (bottom up).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The top down method believes students gain understanding from text as they read. It does not specifically teach phonics but rather relies on students making sense of letters and vocabulary as they are exposed to text.

                            3. Explain in your own words the diagram developed by Rummelhart about the interactive reading model.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The interactive reading model, as developed by David E. Rumelhart in 1977, describes a reading process and the way linguistic elements are processed and interpreted by the brain. The model combines both surface structure systems, such as the sensory, bottom-up portion of reading with deep structure systems, such as the thinking, or top-down, aspects of reading to build meaning and memory for all learners</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>How it works:</p>Readers use both knowledge of word structure and background knowledge to interpret the texts they read. For example, a student who encounters an unknown word might use surface structure systems like graph phonic, or letter-sound, knowledge to decode the word. A different student might find it easier to use deep structure systems like semantic knowledge, such as meaning and vocabulary, to decode the same unknown word. Each student makes connections in different ways. This process validates and supports both methods of understanding, realizing that individuals process information in very different ways.Surface structure processing, also known as bottom-up processing, is the sensory portion of reading. This method of understanding uses knowledge of letter-sound relationships, lexical or word knowledge and syntactic or contextual understanding of the text to make meaning of previously unknown material. This type of processing can be assisted by the teaching of phonemic awareness and sentence structure skills. Students who use only surface structure approaches to understanding often find it difficult to comprehend the text.Deep structure processing, also known as top-down processing, is the thinking aspect of reading. This method employs vocabulary knowledge, background knowledge and social construction to derive meaning from text. This type of processing is often easier for poor readers who might have trouble with word recognition but have knowledge of the text topic. Vocabulary instruction is imperative for these learners to build a larger pool of knowledge on which to draw when faced with unknown text.The most evident benefit of this model is the opportunity for the differentiation that it provides students. Students are not required to fit into a set mold or have identical skill sets to decode and interpret text. They are encouraged to use their own strengths to gain understanding and new information. When used in the classroom setting, students should be encouraged to share their knowledge with classmates or peers. This model allows the reader to bring his own background knowledge to reading and to interact with others to build meaning and memory from the text.Hope this helps a lot! :))<br />

Source: 5-A U.S. ARMY AND MARINE CORPS BATTLEFIELD LOGISTICS by Alan Dennis.
Shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 (Desert Storm), the U.S. Department of Defense realized that there were significant problems in its battlefield logistics systems that provided supplies to the troops at the division level and below. During the Gulf War, it had proved difficult for army and marine units fighting together to share supplies back and forth because their logistics computer systems would not easily communicate. The goal of the new system was to combine the army and marine corps logistics systems into one system to enable units to share supplies under battlefield conditions.The army and marines built separate as-is process models of their existing logistics systems that had 165 processes for the army system and 76 processes for the marines. Both process models were developed over a 3-month time period and cost several million dollars to build, even though they were not intended to be comprehensive.I helped them develop a model for the new integrated battlefield logistics system that would be used by both services (i.e., the to-be model). The initial process model contained 1,500 processes and went down to level 6 DFDs in many places. It took 3,300 pages to print. They realized that this model was too large to be useful. The project leader decided that level 4 DFDs was as far as the model would go, with additional information contained in the process descriptions. This reduced the model to 375 processes (800 pages) and made it far more useful.

Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.
