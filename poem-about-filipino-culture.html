FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.
