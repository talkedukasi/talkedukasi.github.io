</p><p>Often, students who are not of the majority population may not feel as connected to the content as those who are. This "Making Cultural Content Connections" activity is a strategy used to help bridge the gap between students and the content. Students will have an opportunity to research someone that is more culturally similar to them within a particular content area or field of study. This strategy will help students feel a sense of connectedness with, and have an improved perception of personal efficacy as related to, the content area.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brallienest po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>For my Cultural Content Connections Project, I have chosen to write a news article about my community icon.</p><p></p><p>My community icon is Jane Goodall, a renowned primatologist and conservationist who has made significant contributions to the understanding of chimpanzee behavior and the conservation of primates and their habitats. Goodall was born in England and spent much of her childhood in Africa, where she developed a love for animals and a fascination with chimpanzees.</p><p></p><p>In the 1960s, Goodall began studying chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first person to observe and document the complex social and emotional lives of these primates. She made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the fact that chimpanzees use tools and have distinct cultures, and she helped to debunk the myth that only humans had the capacity for complex thought and emotion.</p><p></p><p>Goodall's work has had a profound impact on the scientific community and has helped to raise awareness about the importance of conservation and the need to protect endangered species. In addition to her scientific work, Goodall has also been a vocal advocate for environmental and animal rights issues, and she has founded several organizations dedicated to these causes.</p><p></p><p>As a resident of the community where Goodall conducted much of her research, I have personally benefited from her contributions to our understanding of the natural world and the need to protect it. Her work has inspired me to become more aware of environmental issues and to take action to protect the planet. I believe that her contributions have had a lasting impact on our community and culture, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about and celebrate her work.</p><br />

Due to the restrictions placed on people's mobility, many businesses had to close, which resulted in individuals losing their jobs and income.</p><p></p><p>But because to one person standing up to inspire the bayanihan spirit in everyone, people have discovered a new way to strengthen themselves rather than falling into desperation. <strong>An entrepreneur and University of the Philippines alumna named Ana Patricia "Patreng" Non inspired the bayanihan spirit by setting up a small cart outside of her home in Maginhawa, Quezon City,</strong> where people could buy food and other items to get by for the day and share any extras that could be used by another family.</p><p></p><p>This <strong>straightforward act of sharing and giving has inspired farmers and other organizations to donate,</strong> and it has developed into the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Since then, people from all over the Philippines have started to establish community pantries in their neighborhoods, turning this modest act of kindness into a movement.</p><p></p><p>More than<strong> 200 hundred pantries had been established by May, and the campaign has inspired others to establish community pantries</strong> as far away as our neighbor, Timor Leste. The community pantry movement may have seen obstacles and criticism, but Patreng's efforts to inspire people to support their livelihoods by assisting one another are too admirable to fail.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Five choices for the type of product: </p>News ArticleChildren’s BookPosterModelDigital Presentation<p></p><p></p><p>News related articles:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18397118 </p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Macli-ing Dulag</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Macli-ing Dulag was a respected elder of the Butbut tribe in the mountain village of Bugnay in the Cordilleras. He was considered wise and brave by those in the community, and he served three terms as barrio captain of Bugnay. In 1974, the Marcos regime planned on installing a massive dam along the Chico River. The dam would have been a 1000-megawatt hydroelectric power plant funded by the World Bank. It was planned that the structure would cover 1,400 sq. kilometers of rice terraces, orchards, and local graveyards. The administration thought it would meet little resistance from the indigenous tribes, even if it would displace over 100,000 people from their homes.

</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The people found their voice in Macli-ing Dulag. Though he was not formally educated, Dulag found the right words to defend his people. To this day, Dulag is known for his words against the dam project:

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As our society becomes more culturally diverse, organizations are understanding the need to work with other organizations in order to "turn up the sound," so their voices are heard and their issues will be addressed. This means that individuals and institutions can no longer deny the sometimes uncomfortable realities of cultural diversity. Organizers and activists are realizing that we have to come to grips with our multicultural society, or we won't get anything done. But how do we do that?
</p><p>
</p><p>One Wisconsin labor activist says, "We want to include communities of color, but we just don't know where to begin. We hold open meetings, but no people of color even show up."
</p><p>
</p><p>A neighborhood organization member in South Los Angeles, says, "Last year, we decided to move toward organizing in the Latino community for the simple reason that we have a lot of new immigrants from Central America in the neighborhoods. We wanted to make an authentic multicultural organization, but we learned an important lesson -- it doesn't just happen."
</p><p>
</p><p>Many organizers have begun to come to grips with diversity issues, even though they may not have all the answers. These organizers realize they have to develop new strategies and tactics to attract multicultural interest in their collaborative initiatives. They also know there will be problems to solve if their collaborations are to be effective. This section will discuss how to help organizations collaborate effectively with people of different cultures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>WHY IS MULTICULTURAL COLLABORATION IMPORTANT?
</p><p>It gets everyone to the table. Because most groups have some community-wide concerns, it's essential to get them to the same table, uneven or not. According to John Gardner, the biggest problem of having many groups in society is the war of the parts against the whole. Separately they don’t have the power to resolve a problem, but because they are all tied together, one part can hold up the others for ransom -- everything can be frozen if one group's efforts are focused on thwarting another's
</p><p>It emphasizes common interests rather than differences. Though it's odd and self-destructive, in-fighting has increased dramatically in recent years. Becoming more aware of our similarities, along with cultural differences, doesn't have to paralyze or divide us. Through common interests we can learn to translate "different from me" and "less than me" into "like me in lots of important ways." As a result "difference" becomes less of a barrier to effectiveness.
</p><p>It makes for more effective communication among groups. Understanding how people communicate is the first step toward understanding and respecting each other.
</p><p>It enriches everyone's life when there is shared knowledge of others' cultures. Different communication styles reflect philosophies and worldviews that are the foundations of cultures. New understanding gives us a broader view of our world and the opportunity to see a mirror image of ourselves.
</p><p>It takes advantage of "strength in numbers." History shows that when groups are organized through common purpose they can wield great power and succeed. Because no one group is responsible for a problem, no one group alone can solve it. Competition among groups doesn't aid survival in today's turbulent world.
</p><p>It creates community. As our population becomes more culturally diverse, some cultural groups are experiencing more problems. If we learn to understand and value other cultures and to look at each other as neighbors with similar interests rather than adversaries, we will be more vested in the idea of taking better care of each other. Caring about our neighbors builds a sense of community and unites us in solving community-wide problems.
</p><p>It leads to a more just society. Multicultural collaboration can build collective capacity to help make things better, and promote the consensus that it's important to do so. This offers a good chance at solving complex problems in an atmosphere of trust, cooperation, and mutual respect.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Directions: Read the situation below and answer the questions that follow. Raymond believes that mice exposed to radiowaves will become extra strong. He decides to prove this through an experiment by designing two setups. The first setup is composed of clseven mice placed near a turned on radio for five hours. The second setup is composed of another seven mice which are not exposed to radiowaves coming from a radio. His test also consists of heavy blocks of wood that blocked access to the mouse food. He finds that in the first setup, six out of seven mice exposed to radiowaves can push the blocks away. Meanwhile, five out of seven mice that are not exposed to radiowaves can do the same. Questions: 1. Which is the control group? 2. Can you identify the independent variable? How about the dependent variable?</p><p></p><p>sainyo na points kung maanswer nyu ito</p><br />
