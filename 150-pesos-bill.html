                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Let's start by calculating the total amount Mrs. Dela Vega received from selling the towels and necklaces:</p><p></p><p>Total amount from selling 4 towels = 4 x Php. 150.50 = Php. 602.00</p><p>Total amount from selling necklaces = Let's call the number of necklaces she sold "x"</p><p>Total amount from selling x necklaces = x x Php. 250.75 = Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>So the total amount Mrs. Dela Vega received is:</p><p></p><p>Total amount = Php. 602.00 + Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>Now let's calculate how much the customer paid:</p><p></p><p>Amount paid = Php. 1000.00 + Php. 500.00 = Php. 1500.00</p><p></p><p>So the change Mrs. Dela Vega gave to the customer is:</p><p></p><p>Change = Php. 1500.00 - (Php. 602.00 + Php. 250.75x) = Php. 897.00 - Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>We know that the change she gave is Php. 145.75, so we can set up an equation:</p><p></p><p>Php. 145.75 = Php. 897.00 - Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>Solving for "x", we get:</p><p></p><p>Php. 250.75x = Php. 751.25</p><p>x = 3</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mrs. Dela Vega sold 3 necklaces to the customer. We don't have any information about bracelets, so we cannot answer the question about how many bracelets she sold.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Let's start by finding out how much Mrs. Dela Vega earned from selling the towels and necklaces:</p><p></p><p>4 towels x Php. 150.50 each = Php. 602</p><p></p><p>Let's assume she sold x number of necklaces:</p><p></p><p>Total earnings from necklaces = x necklaces x Php. 250.75 each = Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>Total earnings = Php. 602 + Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>Now let's subtract the total earnings from the amount paid by the customer to find out how much change she gave:</p><p></p><p>Php. 1000 + Php. 500 - (Php. 602 + Php. 250.75x) = Php. 145.75</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the equation:</p><p></p><p>Php. 1500 - Php. 602 - Php. 250.75x = Php. 145.75</p><p></p><p>Php. 897.00 - Php. 250.75x = Php. 145.75</p><p></p><p>Php. 751.25 = Php. 250.75x</p><p></p><p>x = 3</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mrs. Dela Vega sold 3 necklaces.</p><br />
