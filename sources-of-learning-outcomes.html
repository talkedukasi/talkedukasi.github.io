                                            pa summarize po please Review Related Literature po kasi sya pa summarize lang mga kuya ate.The effect sizes are generally similar to other educational interventions that are effective in raising attainment, though the use of digital learning has other benefits. Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</a>

It must be aligned with the needs of clients. It is a good idea to define the intended learning outcomes clearly in advance and with others.______3. At this stage, the social worker begins working with a client to develop a plan to achieve the objectives that works towards addressing the specific issues. Specific action and objectives are designed to make the objectives more attainable._______4. When the contract is concluded, each party does its part to ensure that the contract is complied with. If both parties agreed over revision, the contract may be revised. In general, the social worker is responsible for monitoring progress and obtaining information so that services can be rendered to the client._______5.

The workshop is to consist of three 2-hour meetings in which danger signals, causes of suicide, and community resources that provide counseling will be discussed. Students will volunteer, and half will be assigned to a comparison group that will not partidpate in the workshop. Outcomes will be assessed by comparing the Information learned and attitudes of those attending the meetings with those who do not attend. LE The 40 - Study 2 The researcher plans to observe (unobtrusively) students in each of classrooms-elght visits each of 40 minutes' duration. The purpose of these observations is to look for relationships between the behavior of students and certain teacher behavior patterns.

Study 3 The researcher wishes to study the effects of "Tailure" versus "success" by teaching Junior high students a motor skill during a series of six 10-minute Instructional periods. After each training period, the students will be given feedback on their performance as compared with that of other students. In order to control extraneous variables (such as coordination), the researcher plans to randomly divide the students into two groups-Dalf will be told that their performance was "relatively poor and the other half will be told that they are doing well" Their actual performance will be ignored /​</a>

According to Panigrahi et.al. (2018) proposed that the integration of virtual communities to online learning platforms may cause a better outcome and engagement. Also, Picciano (2002) found out in his study that the success of many online course is dependent upon the nature of student to student and student to faculty interaction. Moreover, in the study of Salamat et.al. (2018) they highlighted that e-learning provides time flexibility to the students and it motivates students to do their work without the help of others. Furthermore, through their study they have found out that the students feel more comfortable when they are using the internet. Salamat et.al (2018) concluded the e-learning system in education is effective for students. Source: Herrera, M.G. (2021).

“Educational Challenges and Opportunities of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic” (Excerpt)
We are living amidst what is potentially one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education, a gigantic educational crisis. As of March 28, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than 1.6 billion children and youth to be out of school in 161 countries. This is close to 80% of the world’s enrolled students. We were already experiencing a global learning crisis, as many students were in school, but were not learning the fundamental skills needed for life. The World Bank’s “Learning Poverty” indicator – the % of children who cannot read and understand at age 10 – stood at 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries – before the outbreak started. This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes even more if we do not act fast.
What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have an immediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning; (2) Increased dropout rates; (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day. Moreover, most countries have very unequal education systems, and these negative impacts will be felt disproportionately by poor children. When it rains, it pours for them.

The World Bank'sLeaming Pove" indicator - the % of children who cannot read and understand atage 10 - stood at 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries - before theoutbreak started. This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes evenmore if we do not act fast.What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have animmediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning (2) Increaseddropout rates: (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day. Moreover,most countries have very unequal education systems, and these negative impacts willbe felt disproportionately by poor children. When it rains, it pours for them.Sourcenog odbank og education/canal-challenges ond-opportune cod-1-pandeStatement of Convention:Statement of Fact:Statement of Opinion:Statement of Preference:penge posagot​</a>

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</h2><br />

The workshop is to consist of three 2-hour meetings in which danger signals, causes of suicide, and community resources that provide counseling will be discussed. Students will volunteer, and half will be assigned to a comparison group that will not partidpate in the workshop. Outcomes will be assessed by comparing the Information learned and attitudes of those attending the meetings with those who do not attend. LE The 40 - Study 2 The researcher plans to observe (unobtrusively) students in each of classrooms-elght visits each of 40 minutes' duration. The purpose of these observations is to look for relationships between the behavior of students and certain teacher behavior patterns.

According to Panigrahi et.al. (2018) proposed that the integration of virtual communities to online learning platforms may cause a better outcome and engagement. Also, Picciano (2002) found out in his study that the success of many online course is dependent upon the nature of student to student and student to faculty interaction. Moreover, in the study of Salamat et.al. (2018) they highlighted that e-learning provides time flexibility to the students and it motivates students to do their work without the help of others. Furthermore, through their study they have found out that the students feel more comfortable when they are using the internet. Salamat et.al (2018) concluded the e-learning system in education is effective for students. Source: Herrera, M.G. (2021).

“Educational Challenges and Opportunities of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic” (Excerpt)
We are living amidst what is potentially one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education, a gigantic educational crisis. As of March 28, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than 1.6 billion children and youth to be out of school in 161 countries. This is close to 80% of the world’s enrolled students. We were already experiencing a global learning crisis, as many students were in school, but were not learning the fundamental skills needed for life. The World Bank’s “Learning Poverty” indicator – the % of children who cannot read and understand at age 10 – stood at 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries – before the outbreak started. This pandemic has the potential to worsen these outcomes even more if we do not act fast.
What should we be worried about in this phase of the crisis that might have an immediate impact on children and youth? (1) Losses in learning; (2) Increased dropout rates; (3) Children missing their most important meal of the day. Moreover, most countries have very unequal education systems, and these negative impacts will be felt disproportionately by poor children. When it rains, it pours for them.
