                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

                                            2. Among the breakthroughs that happened throughout human history, it is perhaps digitization that best defines our current age. Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</a>

                                            How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powersthat-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

Write this in your answer sheet. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powers-that-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                            4. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                            5. 2. Among the breakthroughs that happened throughout human history, it is perhaps digitization that best defines our current age. Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</h2><br />

                            7. How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powersthat-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

                            11. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                            13. Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.
