It's a non-linear methodology that evolved from the practical experiences in its beginnings, which was framed by what technology would allow; initially cameras holding only 10 minutes of negative raw stock at a time yet easily mobile. The methodology allowed for shots to be repeated as often as necessary for best performance and scenes shot out of order for the advantage of convenience and economics. The process is used today in the making of theatrical films, films made for cable, terrestrial television, streaming platforms, and is a process familiar to making documentaries, music videos, and student films. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and pre-production, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and an exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques.</p><p></p><p>3.yes.because mostly of todays generation everybody use electronic device like gadget. this kind of artwork can attract people especially those people who want this kind of stuff</p><br />
