                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I. Introduction</p><p></p><p>Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters that can strike without warning. It is crucial to have a plan in place to ensure the safety of everyone in the community before, during, and after an earthquake. This action plan aims to provide specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound measures for individuals and organizations in the community to prepare for an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>II. The Community Action Plan</p><p></p><p>A. Problem</p><p></p><p>Three environmental problems that are evident within the community are:</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings - Many buildings in the community are not built to withstand earthquakes, which can lead to collapse and severe damage.</p><p></p><p>Inadequate emergency response system - The community lacks a well-coordinated emergency response system to respond promptly and efficiently during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness - The majority of the community lacks awareness and preparedness when it comes to earthquakes, which can lead to panic and confusion during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>B. Suggested Policy/Program/Project</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings:</p><p>a. Retrofitting program - The local government can establish a retrofitting program that will require building owners to retrofit their structures to make them earthquake-resistant. This program can be enforced through inspections, incentives, and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>b. Public education campaign - A public education campaign can be launched to inform the community about the importance of earthquake-resistant buildings and how to retrofit existing structures. The campaign can use various media such as billboards, flyers, and social media to reach a wide audience.</p><p></p><p>Inadequate emergency response system:</p><p>a. Emergency drills - The local government can organize and conduct regular emergency drills for the community, including schools, hospitals, and other public institutions. These drills can help improve coordination and response times during an earthquake.</p><p>b. Establish an emergency response center - The local government can establish an emergency response center that will serve as a central point for coordinating emergency response activities. The center can be staffed by trained personnel and equipped with necessary resources, including communication equipment, medical supplies, and search and rescue tools.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness:</p><p>a. Community awareness program - The local government can organize and conduct a community awareness program that will educate the community about earthquakes, their impacts, and how to prepare for them. This program can include seminars, workshops, and community meetings.</p><p>b. Emergency preparedness kits - The local government can provide emergency preparedness kits to households in the community. These kits can include essential supplies such as food, water, first aid supplies, and communication equipment.</p><p></p><p>C. Pictures/Graphics</p><p></p><p>Include pictures that represent the proposed projects and programs.</p><p></p><p>III. Summary</p><p></p><p>This community action plan aims to address three environmental problems that are evident in the community concerning earthquakes. It proposes specific policies, programs, and projects that are measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound to improve earthquake resilience in the community. The plan includes a retrofitting program, public education campaign, emergency drills, emergency response center, community awareness program, and emergency preparedness kits. By implementing these measures, the community can improve its preparedness and response to earthquakes, reducing the risk of casualties and damages.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor.

There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment.
