                            16. The Three types of Viewing Materials
Dynamic Media- content that is constantly updated and is interactive. It appears on websites, online forums and social media feed. A website is considered dynamic when it is frequently updated or changed. Dynamic media can facilitate interaction between users and a business or product
Static Media- this refers to content that doesn't change. For example, an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine is static, because it remains as printed. It will be the same every time we view it. Static media can also refer to those parts of your website that rarely change.
Stationary Media- REFERS TO THE MATERIALS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED COMMERCIALLY Or ANY OTHER WRITINGS THAT WERE PRODUCED OR PRINTED BY SUCH DEVICES, LIKE BROCHURES, INVITATION LETTERS OR CARDS, ENVELOPES, NOTEBOOKS, PAMPHLETS, ETC.
