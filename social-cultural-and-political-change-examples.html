                                            Although many of us have been “tourists” at some point in our lives, defining what tourism actually is can be difficult. Tourism is the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business or other purposes for not more than one consecutive year.Tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services. As such, tourism is a product of modern social arrangements, beginning in western Europe in the 17th century, although it has antecedents in Classical antiquity.Tourism is distinguished from exploration in that tourists follow a “beaten path,” benefit from established systems of provision, and, as befits pleasure-seekers, are generally insulated from difficulty, danger, and embarrassment. Tourism, however, overlaps with other activities, interests, and processes, including, for example, pilgrimage. This gives rise to shared categories, such as “business tourism,” “sports tourism,” and “medical tourism” (international travel undertaken for the purpose of receiving medical care). We can say that tourism is a very productive activity both for the tourist and the government. As they support each other simultaneously. Also, the government should consider improving the conditions of the country as more and more number of tourist visit their country.Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.Tourism offers opportunities to people from all walks of life, supporting vulnerable groups, including minorities, youth and women among others. More peaceful and more tolerant. Tourism is a driver for peace. It helps promote tolerance between people as they learn and better understand each other's cultures.Tourism has the potential to create beneficial effects on the environment by contributing to environmental protection and conservation. It is a way to raise awareness of environmental values and it can serve as a tool to finance protection of natural areas and increase their economic importance. Tourism is also the most wide-ranging industry in the sense that it demands products from other sectors of the economy. For example, the US State of North Carolina’s top agricultural exports include leaf tobacco, poultry and poultry products, live animals and meat, cotton and cotton linters and forestry products that supply demand throughout the United States and across the globe. These products are also ‘assistance goods’ used by the tourism industry.Tourism policy and planning will drive the appropriate management techniques and tools essential for meeting emerging trends. This transformation must take place in a new world of globalization and competition, in which, at the same time, the world’s population and economies are changing. New technology (particularly in communications and transportation), barriers to travel, political relations and many other factors will affect tourism policy and planning in the future.Comment your reaction paper. ​</a>

                            10. Although many of us have been “tourists” at some point in our lives, defining what tourism actually is can be difficult. Tourism is the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business or other purposes for not more than one consecutive year.Tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services. As such, tourism is a product of modern social arrangements, beginning in western Europe in the 17th century, although it has antecedents in Classical antiquity.Tourism is distinguished from exploration in that tourists follow a “beaten path,” benefit from established systems of provision, and, as befits pleasure-seekers, are generally insulated from difficulty, danger, and embarrassment. Tourism, however, overlaps with other activities, interests, and processes, including, for example, pilgrimage. This gives rise to shared categories, such as “business tourism,” “sports tourism,” and “medical tourism” (international travel undertaken for the purpose of receiving medical care). We can say that tourism is a very productive activity both for the tourist and the government. As they support each other simultaneously. Also, the government should consider improving the conditions of the country as more and more number of tourist visit their country.Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.Tourism offers opportunities to people from all walks of life, supporting vulnerable groups, including minorities, youth and women among others. More peaceful and more tolerant. Tourism is a driver for peace. It helps promote tolerance between people as they learn and better understand each other's cultures.Tourism has the potential to create beneficial effects on the environment by contributing to environmental protection and conservation. It is a way to raise awareness of environmental values and it can serve as a tool to finance protection of natural areas and increase their economic importance. Tourism is also the most wide-ranging industry in the sense that it demands products from other sectors of the economy. For example, the US State of North Carolina’s top agricultural exports include leaf tobacco, poultry and poultry products, live animals and meat, cotton and cotton linters and forestry products that supply demand throughout the United States and across the globe. These products are also ‘assistance goods’ used by the tourism industry.Tourism policy and planning will drive the appropriate management techniques and tools essential for meeting emerging trends. This transformation must take place in a new world of globalization and competition, in which, at the same time, the world’s population and economies are changing. New technology (particularly in communications and transportation), barriers to travel, political relations and many other factors will affect tourism policy and planning in the future.Comment your reaction paper. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:pa brainliest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
