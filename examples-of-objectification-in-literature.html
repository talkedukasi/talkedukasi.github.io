                                            Explain this in tagalog?
The fact that the Philippines never had
a well-developed indigenous system of laws partly proves Our assertion.
Corroborating this would be the leniency of the indigenous legal systems sanctions.
Banishment and slavery, for example, may sound harsh, yet historically these seemingly barbed spikes of the native law were mellowed down by a more elaborate rite of reconciliation for the banished and the absorption of slavery into the more dominant Filipino kinship structure. The existence of an almost exquisitely fine legal system of the present-day Philippines and its notoriously miserable implementation are but vestiges of the Filipino's noisso distant past. Such a non-legalistic frame of mind had, quite naturally, stifled the deveinnmant of moral objectification.
A further reflection will show us that Filipino morality is not at all a subjectivist morality. Though it is non-objective, its subjectivity is rooted not in a right-oriented individualism but in a duty-centered communitarianism, which in return is anchored on his harmonizing worldview.</a>

                            6. Explain this in tagalog?
The fact that the Philippines never had
a well-developed indigenous system of laws partly proves Our assertion.
Corroborating this would be the leniency of the indigenous legal systems sanctions.
Banishment and slavery, for example, may sound harsh, yet historically these seemingly barbed spikes of the native law were mellowed down by a more elaborate rite of reconciliation for the banished and the absorption of slavery into the more dominant Filipino kinship structure. The existence of an almost exquisitely fine legal system of the present-day Philippines and its notoriously miserable implementation are but vestiges of the Filipino's noisso distant past. Such a non-legalistic frame of mind had, quite naturally, stifled the deveinnmant of moral objectification.
A further reflection will show us that Filipino morality is not at all a subjectivist morality. Though it is non-objective, its subjectivity is rooted not in a right-oriented individualism but in a duty-centered communitarianism, which in return is anchored on his harmonizing worldview.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The fact that the Philippines never had</p><p>ang isang mahusay na binuo katutubong sistema ng mga batas ay bahagyang nagpapatunay sa Aming paninindigan.</p><p>Ang pagpapatibay nito ay ang pagpapaubaya ng mga sanction ng mga katutubong legal na sistema.</p><p>Ang pagpapatapon at pang-aalipin, halimbawa, ay maaaring pakinggan, ngunit ayon sa kasaysayan, ang mga tila may tinik na mga spike ng katutubong batas ay pinalambot ng isang mas detalyadong seremonya ng pagkakasundo para sa mga pinalayas at ang pagsipsip ng pang-aalipin sa mas nangingibabaw na istruktura ng pagkakamag-anak ng mga Pilipino. Ang pagkakaroon ng halos katangi-tanging sistemang legal ng kasalukuyang Pilipinas at ang kilalang miserableng pagpapatupad nito ay mga bakas lamang ng napakalayo na nakaraan ng Pilipino. Ang gayong di-legalistikong balangkas ng pag-iisip ay, natural na napigilan ang deveinnmant ng moral objectification.</p><p>Ang karagdagang pagninilay ay magpapakita sa atin na ang moralidad ng Pilipino ay hindi naman isang suhetibistang moralidad. Bagama't hindi ito layunin, ang pagiging suhetibo nito ay hindi nakaugat sa isang indibidwalismong nakatuon sa karapatan kundi sa isang komunitarianismong nakasentro sa tungkulin, na kapalit nito ay nakaangkla sa kanyang nagkakasundo na pananaw sa mundo.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>(correct me if im wrong)</p><p></p><br />
