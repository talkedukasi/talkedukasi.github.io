                                            Task 3: Be an Ace Detective! 
Read the following short stories below and look for an evidence from the text to support the general statement.
A.	Volcanoes are a dangerous force of nature. When a volcano erupts, magma from deep inside the Earth’s crust, travels to the opening of the volcano and comes out as hot lava. This extremely hot liquid rock will burn everything in its path. Volcanoes that are known to erupt are called “active”. There are active volcanoes throughout the world including Indonesia, Russia, New Zealand, Italy, Iceland, Guatemala, and even the United States.
1.	Cite evidence that Volcanoes are so dangerous.

B.	Parents often tell their children to “stop playing around” or “get serious”, but in fact, games are a very valuable way to spend time. Games can help teach young children about social cooperation, following riles, and fairness, all lessons they will need later in life. Active games, like Tag, can also help protect against childhood obesity, an increasingly serious problem in much of the world.
1.	Cite evidence that games are a very valuable way to spend time.

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

Filipinos are thoughtful people. For example, Filipinos often buy pasalubong for their loved ones whenever they travel to different places. These pasalubongs range from T-shirts, to ube jams to key chains, and their sole purpose is to make the recipient feel loved. But gift-giving is just one of the many ways Filipinos show their thoughtfulness. Often, they will take time to check up on their loved ones by sending them texts or private messages (via social media), calling them, or sending letters and greeting cards. Filipinos are also known to invite their relatives and friends to get-togethers to catch up or spend time with one another. There are, of course, other ways Filipinos manifest their thoughtfulness, and the bottom line, really, is that being thoughtful is second nature to Filipinos.

                            4. Task 3: Be an Ace Detective! 
Read the following short stories below and look for an evidence from the text to support the general statement.
A.	Volcanoes are a dangerous force of nature. When a volcano erupts, magma from deep inside the Earth’s crust, travels to the opening of the volcano and comes out as hot lava. This extremely hot liquid rock will burn everything in its path. Volcanoes that are known to erupt are called “active”. There are active volcanoes throughout the world including Indonesia, Russia, New Zealand, Italy, Iceland, Guatemala, and even the United States.
1.	Cite evidence that Volcanoes are so dangerous.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
B.	Parents often tell their children to “stop playing around” or “get serious”, but in fact, games are a very valuable way to spend time. Games can help teach young children about social cooperation, following riles, and fairness, all lessons they will need later in life. Active games, like Tag, can also help protect against childhood obesity, an increasingly serious problem in much of the world.
1.	Cite evidence that games are a very valuable way to spend time.

                            6. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />

It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />

Direction: Read the given paragraph below. Then, identify the topic sentence, the supporting sentences and the concluding sentence. 
Filipinos are thoughtful people. For example, Filipinos often buy pasalubong for their loved ones whenever they travel to different places. These pasalubongs range from T-shirts, to ube jams to key chains, and their sole purpose is to make the recipient feel loved. But gift-giving is just one of the many ways Filipinos show their thoughtfulness. Often, they will take time to check up on their loved ones by sending them texts or private messages (via social media), calling them, or sending letters and greeting cards. Filipinos are also known to invite their relatives and friends to get-togethers to catch up or spend time with one another. There are, of course, other ways Filipinos manifest their thoughtfulness, and the bottom line, really, is that being thoughtful is second nature to Filipinos.
