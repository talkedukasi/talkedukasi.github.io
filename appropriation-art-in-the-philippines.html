                                            What I Have Learned 1. The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and have adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies to become the Contemporary Art of today. 2 Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that produced in our contemporary time, simply put as "art created today." 3. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 4. Contemporary Art is expressions of the artist's thoughts and feelings based on their experience of the here and now which current events, issues and social concerns affecting the society where the artist lives in. 5. Contemporary Philippine artists hail from the different regions of the country and they use a wide variety of art media in their creations. These are materials that are readily available in the locality where the artist resides. 6 Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to come up with a distinct artwork like Performance, Appropriation, Technology, Hybridity and Space. (Mnemonics: PATHS) 7. The distinct features of Contemporary Philippine Art include Communal, Holistic, Intuitive, Multi-focal, Integrative and Creative Process. (Mnemonics: CHIMIC) 8 Contemporary Philippine Art considers not only the artist but also the participation of the community through the viewers wherein the experience is not solely confined to the creator of the art but also to the viewer of the art. 9. Integrative Art comes in different sizes and shapes, forms and styles as observed in Junk Art which is a sculptural rendition using discarded or used materials. 10. The combination of resourcefulness and creativity can bring out the artist in everyone.​</a>

Fill in the missing boxes with the appropriate information 1. Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.pa help po plsss ​</a>
