                            6. 2. What Filipino values should be highlighted in confronting the following ethical issues in business: nepotism,copyright infringement, tax evasion, and bribery?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>NEPOTISM;</p><p></p><p>Nepotism is a specific form of favoritism in which a business leader prioritizes hiring a family member over a nonfamily member. While it is certainly a controversial topic in business ethics, it isn't inherently unethical to employ family members. The nature of your business, standards for employment and consistency in policies affect the ethical nature of nepotism.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Basic Concerns</p><p>The basic concern about nepotism in business is that it contradicts typical customs in employment to hire and promote the most qualified candidate for a job. While a son, daughter or nephew may be the most capable employee, nepotism sometimes leads to relatives getting jobs when other candidates have stronger education and work experience. Even when a relative is most qualified, hiring him may give the impression of nepotism.</p><p></p><p>Business Structure</p><p>The ethics of nepotism in business have a lot to do with the business structure. A family business, often established as a sole proprietorship, partnership or S corporation, typically means you own and control the operation by yourself or with family members who are partners. If you partner with nonfamily members or formalize a corporation with shareholders, the business takes on a formal standing that is distinct from your involvement. In these cases, nepotism is more questionable because other parties have an ownership stake or vested interest in the operation.</p><p></p><p>Policy Consistency</p><p>In large companies, nepotism isn't inherently wrong, although some people believe it is unethical in all cases. A 2009 Family Business Institute article noted that companies may benefit from nepotism if it consistently enforces fair policies. In a small organization, employees are often hired from internal referrals rather than formal job postings. Some companies encourage referrals of family members and friends to open positions. The ethics in this type of culture relate to the company's consistency in accepting family referrals and giving candidates fair access to jobs.</p><p></p><p>Practical Matters</p><p>Along with the ethical nature of nepotism, you need to consider the practical business matters. While family businesses often establish legacies from multiple generations of family involvement, not all companies benefit from nepotistic behaviors. In some cases, well-meaning owners or operators hire underqualified, unmotivated family members that aren't worth what they are paid. Even worse, they undermine the workplace culture and increase the burden on other staff. Balancing your desire to help family while managing a successful business is key.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Hope it helps!!</p><p>#Carry on learning!!</p><p></p><p>#Correct me if I'm wrong!!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We might suppose that in the matter of taking life all peoples would agree on condemnation. On the contrary, in the matter of homicide, it may be held that one kills by custom his two children, or that a husband has a right of life and death over his wife or that it is the duty of the child to kill his parents before they are old. It may be the case that those are killed who steal fowl, or who cut their upper teeth first, or who are born on Wednesday. Among some peoples, a person suffers torment at having caused an accidental death, among others, it is a matter of no consequence. Suicide may also be a light matter, the recourse of anyone who has suffered some slight rebuff, an act that constantly occurs in a tribe. It may be the highest and noblest act a wise man can perform. The very tale of it, on the other hand, may be a matter for incredulous mirth, and the act itself, impossible to conceive as human possibility. Or it may be a crime punishable by law, or regarded as a sin against the gods. (pp.45-46)</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>#Carryonlearning<br />

Ultimately, prioritizing ethical behavior is not only the right thing to do but can also lead to long-term business success and sustainability.</p><br />

Children are not expected to leave their parents’ house until they get married. Even after then, many couples opt to stay with or close to their or their spouse’s parents.</p><p>Also, they’re expected to care for their aging parents instead of sending them to a retirement home.</p><p>The value that most Filipinos put into caring for one’s family can also be seen as one of the reasons why nurses and caregivers from the country provide their patients and clients with a high level of care.</p><p></p>Humor and positivity<p>Optimism, humor, and positivity are valued traits in the Philippines.Filipinos love celebrations and festivities. The country has a long list of national holidays, and many provinces and cities have their own sets of local holidays. Meanwhile, they still find quality time for their families to celebrate birthdays, Christmases, and other instances.</p><p>At the same time, in the face of difficult or challenging situations, members of the community are encouraged to look at the brighter side of things. The inclination for finding the good in the bad can be traced to the country’s location, which lies in the path of typhoons and sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p><p>In a place where natural calamities are commonplace, humor and positivity work as a coping mechanism, much like how some children laugh to hide their embarrassment after slipping or falling.</p><p></p>Flexibility and adaptability<p>The term bahala na, which can be translated to “whatever happens, happens,” is one of the more familiar phrases used in the country.</p><p>It is perhaps the most representative of how Filipinos value adaptability and quick thinking. The expression exemplifies one’s belief in a higher power and submitting one’s fate to elements that cannot be controlled.</p><p>People who use the term bahala na do not see anything wrong with it, as it serves as a sort of positive affirmation that allows them to deal with a problem right then and there.</p><p>However, those who call it a negative Filipino trait often view it as a form of fatalistic submission or a way to absolve one from the responsibility of their actions.</p><p></p>Faith and religion<p>Spirituality is deeply embedded in the Filipino culture. A form of animism was already being practiced in many pre-colonial societies and Islam has been firmly established in the southern islands even before the pre-Hispanic era.</p><p>These days, religion still plays a big part in society and the everyday lives of Filipinos.</p><p>The Catholic Church’s views still affect the passing of some laws, most towns still hold fiestas to honor their patron saints, and many regular non-working national holidays are dedicated to celebrating various religious activities and events.</p><p>To many Filipinos, religion helps shape their values and principles.</p><p></p>Filipino hospitality<p>Filipinos are naturally hospitable. Guests can be expected to extend a very warm welcome to their guests regardless of where they come from, how well they know their host, and why they’re visiting someone’s home.</p><p>Hosts typically provide their guests with food and entertainment and, if there’s time, a tour around the local destinations.</p><p>In the Philippines, no one leaves with an empty stomach. Before they leave, guests are even entreated to take home pasalubong or souvenirs, which often come in the form of delicacies and local sweets.</p><p></p>Other positive Filipino traits and characteristics<p>Aside from the ones mentioned, Filipinos also possess the following positive traits.</p><p></p>Respect for the elderly<p>Filipinos have high regard for their elderly, including their parents. Even young adults still practice taking their elders’ hands and saying “mano po” when they arrive at their homes.</p><p>Industrious attitude</p><p>Another one of the great characteristics of Filipinos is their being resourceful and industrious. They are determined to finish their set goals despite difficult circumstances and limited resources.</p><p></p>Generosity<p>Filipinos are naturally helpful and generous people. They give as much as they can and extend help to family members — and even strangers — when needed. This is seen through the abundance of charity drives and foundations in the country, especially when calamities arise.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Free enterprise, also known as free market or capitalism, is an economic system driven by supply and demand.
