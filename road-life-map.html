                            4. How do you draw your road map to a successful life?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Be positive in life that is the key</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Always hold patience, be patient with a beautiful patience</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1- Find out your definition of success</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Success can be fun when you define it and achieve it on your own terms.”</p><p></p><p>The first step to creating a roadmap to success is to discover what success is for you.</p><p></p><p>You might be running behind money or fame. But if money or fame doesn’t leave you satisfied at the end of the day, think what you’ll be doing with it. Will your future-self feel blessed with all the money you will be having? If not, then being rich is not the true success that you want to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Start with your childhood vision and see if it still resonates. A big home or a small farm in the countryside? A private business party or a beach party with friends? What do you love more?</p><p></p><p>Your success might not even be materialistic. You might be content with your life partner, a happy family, many friends and people who admire your personality.</p><p></p><p>The point here is you should first find out what success means to you.  </p><p></p><p>2- Go over, inspect each dimension of your life</p><p></p><p>When success means having a peaceful life, you don’t have to leave your business and family for the Himalayas. If you think that’s the best way out, you might regret later. The real success is which leads you to overall contentment.</p><p></p><p>So find out how your dream affects –</p><p></p><p>Your career</p><p>Your financial status</p><p>Your health – mental and physical</p><p>Your beliefs, and</p><p>Your relationships.</p><p>Consider all these facets and determine a direction which can lead you to a successful, healthier and happier life.</p><p></p><p>Find how development in each of these areas will echo in the “success” you have visualized.</p><p></p><p>3- Prioritize and set main goals</p><p></p><p>Now that you have your vision clear, set immediate and intermediate goals to achieve the ultimate target.</p><p></p><p>Don’t worry if you can’t think of the various things involved right away. Goal-setting and your roadmap to success don’t take a solid form in a day. It takes rounds of brainstorming sessions. So, don’t be desperate to jump into conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Make a list to start with and keep coming back to it. Think about all the different aspects of your life and see if the set goals contradict to what you’re aiming for. Some goals might not align, and it’s perfectly fine.</p><p></p><p>You might be aiming for a successful business but being competitive might hurt your vision of a happy community around. So, thinkand realign.</p><p></p><p>4- Mould your life to achieve the goals</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Will, who you are now, lead you to who you want to be in the future?”</p><p>– Brendon Burchard</p><p></p><p>Brendon Burchard is a coach, best-selling author in self-help, podcaster and Youtuber. He says that no matter how small you start, start something that matters. Well, you have all the intermediate goals and your measurement of success set, now is the time for actions.</p><p></p><p>And your behavior might project a major obstacle in that. Analyze your habits and find out what changes you need to adopt in your habits to become the person you envisioned.  </p><p></p><p>Reshaping the present habits and adapting to new ones isn’t difficult. All you need is persistence and the will to work towards your success, every moment.</p><p></p><p>5- Review the progress and make changes</p><p></p><p>Once you are on the path to success, you need to review your goals and measure your progress. This review can be daily, monthly or whenever you want. Check your plan to see how far you’ve come and reward yourself for it.</p><p></p><p>If waking up early was one of the goals, you can gift yourself a new coffee mug. And if you planned to run 3 kilometers a day, you may like new running shoes. The review will also keep a check on what didn’t work and thus, you can incorporate changes as needed.</p><p></p><p>Always remember who you are, what you want to be and how far you have come. Having a vision and strategy helps you in your journey, but it’s you who have to execute it and follow without fail.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.”</p><p>– Thomas A. Edison</p><p></p><p>While you’re following your roadmap and reviewing it, you will feel the need to revise from time to time. And it’s absolutely normal.</p><p></p><p>There can be some goals which might feel irrelevant and something else, more important. So, be flexible and adapt to the situation. But keep your mission in mind. Your roadmap will inspire you to go further.</p><p></p><p>Get onboard.</p><br />

                        MAPPING YOUR ROAD LIFE TO SUCCESS<p> </p>I. Factors to lead up to successEducation: An educated individual is familiar with their profession's facts, figures, and information and is aware of current trends. And so, in my case, I invested in my education much more than anything else. Skill: Your possibilities to advance in your job will improve as your skill set grows and gets more refined.Network: The secret to advancing in life is having a network of people who are there for you and support you.II. Present conditionDue to the present condition that are roadblocks to success, especially those you cannot control, such as the economy and health conditions, it is impossible to achieve something.However, they don't stop you; instead, it just slows you down.I thought of giving up, but I pushed myself to at least put in 30 minutes daily to make a change.III. Medical History/ Family HistoryCancerous cells run in my family. My grandmother died from ovarian cancerMy father was diagnosed with throat cancer. However, I have asthma, which might lead to lung cancer a few years later.IV. Medical History and HabitsI do not indulge in alcoholic beverages (only occasionally and for social functions), I do not smoke, and I never use illicit drugs. Because I am a workaholic, I am sleep-deprived.<p> </p>V. Physical ActivitiesThat time commitment could seem like a big ask in my hectic life. The good news is that getting in shape doesn't require scheduling gym sessions. Exercises performed outside are equally as beneficial as those performed indoors and can be more enjoyable.I try to do it three times a week, and I go hiking or kayaking on the weekends. <p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29186194</p><br />

I’ve made a transition in recent years in the way I think and talk about God’s will.</p><p>The will of God is a mysterious, elusive and frustrating concept for many people.</p><p></p><p>Too often, we have made it into a game that borders on God playing “keep away” with us.</p><p></p><p>We speak of God’s will as though it was something he hides or does not want us to know.</p><p>===============================================</p>QUESTION<p></p><p>2. The Lord mapped out a journey for you, what milestones along the road helped you find your way?</p><p></p>ANSWER<p></p><p>2.) You’ll learn, as you get older, that rules are made to be broken. Be bold enough to live life on your terms, and never, ever apologize for it. Go against the grain, refuse to conform, take the road less traveled instead of the well-beaten path. Laugh in the face of adversity, and leap before you look. Dance as though EVERYBODY is watching. March to the beat of your own drummer. And stubbornly refuse to fit in.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HOPE IT HELP<p></p>BRAINLIESTPOINTSRATE<br />
