                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Finding Your Voice: In Creative Writing, it is important to find your own unique style and use it to convey your message.</p><p></p><p>2. Show Don’t Tell: Creative Writing emphasizes the importance of showing rather than telling. This encourages readers to come to their own conclusions and adds depth to the story.</p><p></p><p>3. Using Imagery: Creative Writing encourages the use of vivid imagery to bring the story to life and help readers connect with the characters and the setting.</p><p></p><p>4. Writing with Passion: Creative Writing requires you to use your own personal experiences and emotions to create an engaging story.</p><p></p><p>5. Editing and Revising: Creative Writing requires you to constantly edit and revise your work in order to make it the best it can be.</p><br />

                        <p>Today I learned that Health Appraisal Procedures involve a systematic assessment of an individual's health status, which includes gathering and analyzing relevant health information, identifying potential health risks, and developing appropriate health interventions.</p><p></p><p>This learning is important because Health Appraisal Procedures help healthcare providers identify an individual's health needs, develop a comprehensive health plan, and monitor the effectiveness of the interventions implemented. Through this process, healthcare providers can help prevent diseases, promote health, and improve the quality of life of individuals.</p><p></p><p>I realized that Health Appraisal Procedures can involve various assessment tools, such as health history questionnaires, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. These assessment tools are essential in identifying potential health problems and developing appropriate interventions. Moreover, Health Appraisal Procedures are not limited to clinical settings but can also be done in community settings, schools, and workplaces to promote population health</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Friction</strong> is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It is not a fundamental force, like gravity or electromagnetism. Instead, scientists believe it is the result of the electromagnetic attraction between charged particles in two touching surfaces. Friction is used in car brakes, when we walk or climb a hill, making a fire, skiing down a hill, and more.</p><p>Examples:</p>Rubbing both hands together to create heat.A sled sliding across snow or ice.Skis sliding against snow.<p></p><p><strong>Gravity</strong> is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. I learned that friction and gravity have a lot of purpose to us. It helps us in our daily lives. </p><p></p><p>2. By learning more about friction, we are aware of the cons and prons that it may bring to us. We now know the reason why we use lubricants to make the floor slippery or why our hands heat after rubbing it for a long time.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>make something abstract, like an emotion or theory, seem more concrete and tangible to the reader. Also, by using imagery, we can evoke the feeling we want to talk about with our readers. While in Diction, it forms one of its centrally important literary elements, as writers use words to convey action, reveal character, imply attitudes, identify themes, and suggest values. And lastly, I can say that Figures of Speech are a very important method of communication in our society. They specify between different shades of meaning and give more accurate descriptions. I also learned different examples of common figures of speech include the simile, metaphor, pun, personification, hyperbole, understatement, paradox and oxymoron.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ACTIVE VOICE</p><p></p><p>Active voice is a grammatical voice common in many of the world's languages. It is the unmarked voice for clauses featuring a transitive verb in nominative–accusative languages, including English and most other Indo-European languages.</p><p></p><p>PASSIVE VOICE</p><p></p><p>A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages. In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed. </p><br />
