Who do you think would benefit from these speeches in particular? Be able to explain your answer.1.All of those nights we spent cramming for the test the next morning, all of the books we read and the essays we wrote, all of the lessons we learned from not only our teachers, but our friends as well, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrrible experiences we have had throughout high school and the other years we spent in K-12 education have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast.2.No man is an island. Everyone needs someone to depend on. Nobody can live without the help of each other. Be good and be friendly.3.Life is beautiful. Sulking will not do you good. It would just make you sad. Go out and explore the beauty of surroundings. Again, life is beautiful to waste it crying over unimportant things.4.Supressing your anger is not good for any person. It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it. This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</a>

One of the dreadful combats that shook the globe was the continuing battle against Covid
19. The global Coronavirus pandemic spread like a wildfire as it continued to harm the public
health and the life of the people. It had brought a life changing impact on people around the world.
The good life that everyone had dreamt of, suddenly turned topsy-turvy. Since, the virus was first
discovered in the last quarter of 2019, it had infected millions of people. Many had lost their lives
amid the pandemic. Life became feeble, dusted and perished like bubbles in the air as positive
cases constantly rising up in the different parts of the world. Some were silently screaming of the
pain of losing their loved ones while facing the nonstop day-to-day battle against the horrible virus.
Corona Virus Disease or Covid19 was a nightmare that constantly haunting the quiet and peaceful
life of people. It was a pest that destroying the country’s economy. Consequently, the global
economy fell like dried leaves on the ground. Many businesses, large or small closed due to this
incurable disease, as a result many people lost their jobs and continued to fall in the hands of
poverty and were locked in great depression. How painfully beautiful to think that the world was
getting so dangerous. It was not safe anymore to be alive.

government was moving and was constantly looking for a solution to overcome and fight Covid 19.

The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of "shining morning faces" and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling. She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech, she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off by heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it, especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it. After what seemed to her a year ... about ten seconds in reality... she said faintly, "Take your Testaments, please," and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed.

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beauty is a highly subjective concept that can be difficult to define. However, most people would agree that it refers to qualities that are pleasing or attractive to the senses. Beauty is often associated with features such as symmetry, balance, and proportion, as well as qualities like kindness, compassion, and grace. In many cultures, beauty is also linked to cultural ideals and standards, which can vary widely.</p><p></p><p>One interesting aspect of beauty is that it is often closely tied to our emotions. When we see something that we find beautiful, we may feel a sense of joy or peace. This emotional response to beauty may be hardwired into our brains, as research has shown that the areas of the brain responsible for emotion and pleasure are activated when we experience beauty. Ultimately, beauty is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and what one person finds beautiful may be completely different from what another person finds attractive.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literature has always been one effective way to explore and address social issues in human culture. Stories, plays, and other types of fictional media often have some social or cultural concern embedded in the thematic background of a narrative. A social issue is some problem or concern connected to a larger issue that affects society in general. Often, the social issues brought forward in fiction reflect contemporary concerns in the author's own world.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</h2><br />

Gayunpaman, mahalagang tandaan na ang kagandahan ay subjective, at kung ano ang nakikita ng isang tao na kaakit-akit, ang iba ay maaaring hindi.

Ang isang magandang tao sa una ay maaaring makaakit ng pansin, ngunit ang kanilang katalinuhan ang magbibigay sa kanila ng paggalang at paghanga.
