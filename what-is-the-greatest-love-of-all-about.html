It is essential for our natural environment and ourselves. It is our duty to take part in caring the environment as the amount of waste is increasing rapidly. My brother Sam loves to recycle and he encourages us all to take part especially when you can get a small income for doing so. Most of us, always need a little extra money now and then for different things. One way he makes some money is by recycling cans, bottles, newspapers, and other containers. He usually gets about 300-500 pesos a month by recycling most of his rubbish. It is not a lot of money but he is happy to have a little extra income. Most of the time he uses the money to take his wife to the cinema. His wife is always looking forward in going to cinema every end of the month. Sam has always been careful with his money and teaches his children the importance of money and how to protect the environment by recycling.Questions:1. What does Sam want to people do?2.

When we ascribe value or worth to something, we will seek to protect and hoard it for ourselves. The danger lies in placing something other than God as the object of our greatest value and love. By treasuring Jesus above all else, our hearts will be properly aligned and attuned to His purposes.​</a>

Dogs Rule                by: Luke See    Dogs are the greatest pets ever. There is really no denying it. Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.    If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.     Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1. What is the author's point of view expressed in the selection?2-4.

                                            Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.
7
Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.

We pray for blessings
We pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
All the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things
'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You're near
What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise
We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt your goodness, we doubt your love
As if every promise from Your Word is not enough
All the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe
When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not our home
What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
What if trials of this life
The rain, the storms, the hardest nights
Are your mercies in disguise

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5. How did the author related to his topic the world? ​</a>

It is our duty to take part in caring the environment as the amount of waste is increasing rapidly. My brother Sam loves to recycle and he encourages us all to take part especially when you can get a small income for doing so. Most of us, always need a little extra money now and then for different things. One way he makes some money is by recycling cans, bottles, newspapers, and other containers. He usually gets about 300-500 pesos a month by recycling most of his rubbish. It is not a lot of money but he is happy to have a little extra income. Most of the time he uses the money to take his wife to the cinema. His wife is always looking forward in going to cinema every end of the month.

                            17. Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.
7
Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.

We pray for blessings
We pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
All the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things
'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You're near
What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise
We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt your goodness, we doubt your love
As if every promise from Your Word is not enough
All the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe
When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not our home
What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
What if trials of this life
The rain, the storms, the hardest nights
Are your mercies in disguise

Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1.

                            29. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.
