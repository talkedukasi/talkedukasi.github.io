General Statement: Owls and bats have similarities and differences.
Owls and Bats
There are many ways that owls and bats are similar. Owls and bats are both nocturnal. This
means that they sleep during the day and they are awake at night. At night, they hunt for their
food. Owls and bats eat some of the same types of food such as insects and small rodents.
While owls and bats can both fly, only one is considered to be a type of bird. Owls are birds
while bats are mammals. Unlike owls, bats have fur instead of feathers. Owls hatch from eggs
but bats are born alive.

after he was "presentable," as Alice had often said.

                                            I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

1. Some animals are nocturnal. This means that they are awake and
moving at night. Rats, mice and bats are examples of this nocturnal
animals.
2. A habitat is the natural home environment of animals. Animals have
different habitats. Birds live in nests, fishes live in water and cats live
on land. All of them can survive on their own habitat.
3.Yesterday was Anthony’s 10th birthday. He had three wishes. His
first wish, was good health for his family. Second, that his father will
be able to find a job. Lastly, that this pandemic will end.
4.There are many reasons why people dance. Some dance for fun,
because they enjoy it. Others dance for exercise and weight loss .
Dancing can really get your heart beating. These are the reasons why
people dance.
5.As I was running along the road, I remembered that I had left my
lunch box on the kitchen table. I had to go back and get it. When I
arrived home, I saw the clock, and knew I was going to be late. I arrived
after the teacher had begun her presentation.
6.It was early in the morning. Joan woke up with a hungry stomach.
She got dressed and went to the kitchen. She prepared a small pan
and fried some dried fish and eggs. After that, Joan put two pieces of
pandesal on a plate and ate them with a cup of milk.
7.As a Grade five pupil, Ellaine was already self -motivated and self -
directed in many ways. She would assist her mother in some
household chores and some errands. 
On days when there would be no
classes, she would go with her father in the market and would help
sell meat and vegetables. On weekdays, she would study her lessons
and do her assignments by herself.
8.Last night, was my Lola’s 70th birthday. Her children and
grandchildren sponsored it. Around 5:30 PM, we began gathering
around the kitchen. My brother and I sang a beautiful song for her. At
6:30 we started to give her birthday gifts then we had dinner at 7:00.
My Lola was so happy while opening all of her gifts. It was indeed a
joyous celebration.
9.Lightning and thunder are related events. 
Lightning is a sudden, violent
flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or
between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long
and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature
of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt
to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that
we hear as thunder.
10.All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.
Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will
still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does
not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter
into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when
paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</a>

food. Owls and bats eat some of the same types of food such as insects and small rodents.

while bats are mammals. Unlike owls, bats have fur instead of feathers. Owls hatch from eggs
but bats are born alive.

                            13. I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

9.Lightning and thunder are related events. 
Lightning is a sudden, violent
flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or
between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long
and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature
of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt
to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that
we hear as thunder.
10.All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.
Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will
still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does
not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter
into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when
paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</h2><br />

So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift

You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too

All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)

I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But

And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph
