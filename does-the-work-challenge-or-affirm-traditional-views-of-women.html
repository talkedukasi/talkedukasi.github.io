How do male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved? 4. Does the work challenge or affirm traditional views of women? 5. How do the images of women in the story reflect patriarchal social forces that have impeded women's efforts to achieve full equality with men? 6. What marital expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have? 7. What behavioral expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have? 8. If a female character were male, how would the story be different (and vice versa)? 9. How does the marital status of a character affect her er decisions or happiness? 10. How does culture view women vs. men? 11. How is the relationship between men and women portrayed? 12. What are the power relationships between men and women (or characters assuming male/female roles)? 13. Do characters take on traits from opposite genders? How so? How does this change others' reactions to them? 14. What does the work reveal about the operations (economically, politically, socially, or psychologically) of patriarchy? 15. What does the work imply about the possibilities of sisterhood as a mode of resisting patriarchy?​</a>

Its achievements have been stupendous, but if we look at the premises that underlie it, we find assumptions and priorities that look increasingly shopworn. Thirty years ago, affirmative action was invented on the basis of these five appropriate premises:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Adult, white males make up something called the U.S. business mainstream.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. The U.S. economic edifice is a solid, unchanging institution with more than enough space for everyone.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Women, blacks, immigrants, and other minorities should be allowed in as a matter of public policy and common decency.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. How are</strong><strong> women's lives portrayed in the work?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," women's lives are portrayed primarily in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections. The story depicts women as taking care of children and managing household tasks, while men are depicted in more professional roles.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Is the</strong><strong> form and content of the work influenced by the writer's gender?</strong></p><p>This is not specified in the critique but one can approach it as that as a woman writer Paz Marquez Benitez could have chosen to represent the women characters differently.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. How do</strong><strong> male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," the male characters often relate to the female characters in a patriarchal and possessive manner. The central relationship in the story, between Alfredo and Julia, is a source of conflict and ultimately unresolved. Alfredo's continuing affection for Julia creates distance in his marriage and prevents him from fully committing to his wife.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Does the</strong><strong> work challenge or affirm traditional views of women?</strong></p><p>The critique suggests that "Dead Stars" reinforces traditional views of women as being relegated to domestic roles and as objects of men's affections.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. How do the</strong><strong> images of women in the story reflect patriarchal social forces that have impeded women's efforts to achieve full equality with men?</strong></p><p>The images of women in the story, who are primarily depicted in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections, reflect patriarchal social forces that have limited women's opportunities and autonomy.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. What</strong><strong> marital expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>The characters are expected to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriage, with men as the head of the household and women as subservient. These expectations create distance and dissatisfaction in the marriage between Alfredo and Esperanza.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What</strong><strong> behavioral expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>Characters are expected to conform to traditional gender norms in terms of their behavior and emotions. Alfredo's emotions and behavior are constrained by societal expectations that men should not show vulnerability or be emotionally attached to women other than their wives.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. If a female</strong><strong> character were male, how would the story be different (and vice versa)?</strong></p><p>If Julia were a male character, the story would likely focus on a different kind of power imbalance, as a man in a relationship with a woman would not be constrained by the same societal expectations. It's possible that the story would have a different outcome as well, with the relationship between Julia and Esperanza being more of a rivalry.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

The existence of trains and railroad disasters existed in 1870sIn Victorian period and society, the lives of women are restricted. Since antiquity and until recently, women have been considered as different and inferior to men, and legally as minors. Consequently, it was neither subject nor even object of history. The sources say little about it. For a long time, moreover, historians were not interested in it.<p></p>Strength of the woman present in the textMrs. Louise Mallard is seen to be hopeful, faithful, and smart. She knows how to react in the right situations. Even if she has her private thoughts she knows better not to show them. But she is not pretentious. In the story, it shows that her love is separate. She loves herself and she does for her husband. So one of her strengths is that she knows herself. <p></p>Conflicts between man and woman in the storyIn the story, marriage is seen as an oppression. Before the 20th century, women's only roles are to become wives and mothers. They are not allowed to do much anything unless approved by a man in their lives, like a father or a husband. For men, marriage is considered as a right for them and nothing changes. For women, marriage is imprisonment. Louise rationalizes that women does not really marry for love and so does men. Women marry for financial and economic reasons and men does so for becoming an emblem of a society. <p></p>Roles of a woman found in the textObviously, as she is a wife, her role is dote over the husband and take care of them. <p></p>Gender inequalities found in the storyWomen were regarded as home keepers.

Also, that women during those times were expected to behave in such ways that are not taught to men. <p></p>Work challenge and affirm traditional views of womenIt does challenge the traditional views of women. It is always expected that when husbands die, the widows are depressed with the loss and they grieve but Mallard, without malicious intent, did not feel that way. As she is sad for the death of her partner, she was also happy of her being fr//33 from the marriage. <p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15535313</p><p>FULL STORY https://brainly.ph/question/14173741</p><br />
