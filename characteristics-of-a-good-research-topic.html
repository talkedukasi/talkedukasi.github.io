Give the guidelines to effective writing of historical research? 10. What are the characteristics of historical research? 11. What could be good objects or topics for historical research? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Historical research enables you to explore and explain the meanings, phases and characteristics of a phenomenon or process at a particular point of time in the past. We differentiate historical research as a research strategy from the research of history, which refers to research in the discipline of history.</p><p> </p><p>2. Choose a general topic that interests you. You should start fairly broad, like "Civil War Battles" or "Women during the 19th Century." Be prepared to narrow that topic down. Ultimately your paper will have a very narrow focus, but identifying an era or general topic that interests you is a good place to start.</p><p></p><p>3. What is historical research? Historical research relies on a wide variety of sources, both primary &amp; secondary including unpublished material. Found in public records &amp; legal documents, minutes of meetings, corporate records, recordings, letters, diaries, journals, drawings.</p><p></p><p>4. </p><p></p><p>5. Why is external criticism important? External criticism is when historians check the validity of a source to verify whether or not it's authentic. This process is important regarding analyzing data, because we have to question whether or not we can trust the data and use it as a reference point.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Situations wherein research is important and applicable in everyday life:</p><p>When making purchasing decisions: Researching the features, quality, and price of a product can help you make an informed decision.</p><p>When seeking medical treatment: Researching medical conditions and treatment options can help you understand your options and make informed decisions about your health.</p><p>When planning a trip: Researching travel destinations, accommodations, and activities can help you plan a safe and enjoyable trip.</p><p>When pursuing higher education: Researching colleges, universities, and academic programs can help you make informed decisions about your education and future career.</p><p>When making financial decisions: Researching investment options, loans, and credit cards can help you make smart financial decisions.</p><p>2. The Code of Ethics is important in doing a research study because it helps ensure that the study is conducted ethically, fairly, and with the welfare of the participants in mind. All policies should be followed to ensure that the research is conducted in a way that is consistent with ethical principles and guidelines. Failure to follow the policies may result in ethical violations and harm to the participants or the research itself.</p><p></p><p>3.If I were to compare research to a thing, it would be a magnifying glass. Research, like a magnifying glass, allows us to examine and investigate things in greater detail and uncover hidden information or insights. Just as a magnifying glass can help us see things more clearly, research can help us gain a deeper understanding of a topic or phenomenon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Qualitative research.</p><p>Tentative Topic: The impact of social media on mental health.</p><p>Question 1: How does social media use affect individuals' mental health and well-being?</p><p>Question 2: What coping strategies do individuals use to manage negative effects of social media on their mental health?</p><p>Question 3: How can social media platforms be designed to promote positive mental health and well-being?</p><br />
