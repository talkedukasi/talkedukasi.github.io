                            6. Essay: Kindly elaborate further based on your understanding the following famous quotations of Jose Rizal below: 1. "The people do not complain because they have no voice; do not move because they are lethargic, and you say that they do not suffer because you have not seen their hearts bleed." -Jose Rizal, Noli Me Tangere 2. "In the Philippines you are not considered to be honorable unless you have been to jail." -Jose Rizal, Noli Me Tangere 3. "Why independence, if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow?" -Jose Rizal, El Filibusterismo 4. "We must win when we deserve it, by elevating reason and the dignity of the individual, loving justice and the good and the great, even dying for it. - Jose Rizal, El Filibusterismo#answerbrieflyandconsicely!!​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In this quote, Rizal is highlighting the plight of the Filipino people who were suffering under Spanish colonial rule. He is suggesting that the people are not apathetic, but rather that they are powerless to effect change because they lack the means to do so. Rizal is pointing out that the people are not voiceless because they do not have anything to say, but rather because their voices are suppressed by the ruling authorities. He is also saying that the people are not lazy, but rather that they are tired and exhausted from years of oppression and exploitation. Finally, Rizal is pointing out that the suffering of the people is real and profound, even if it is not always visible on the surface.</p><p></p><p>2. This quote is a commentary on the state of the Philippines during Rizal's time, where corruption and abuse of power were rampant. Rizal is suggesting that the legal system was so corrupt that being sent to prison was a badge of honor, as it was a sign that the person had stood up against the corrupt authorities. This quote also suggests that the concept of honor in the Philippines was tied to notions of resistance and rebellion against those in power.</p><p></p><p>3. In this quote, Rizal is expressing his skepticism about the idea of independence for the Philippines. He is suggesting that simply gaining independence from the Spanish colonizers would not be enough to ensure a better future for the Filipino people. Rizal is pointing out that there was a risk that the new ruling class would simply replace the old one, continuing the cycle of oppression and exploitation. He is arguing that true change can only come from a deeper transformation of society, one that goes beyond political independence.</p><p></p><p>4. This quote is a call to action for the Filipino people to fight for their rights and dignity. Rizal is suggesting that the fight for justice and freedom is not an easy one, and that it may require sacrifice and even death. He is also suggesting that the fight for justice must be based on reason and the dignity of the individual, rather than on violence or revenge. This quote is a powerful reminder that the fight for justice and freedom requires not only courage, but also a deep commitment to the common good.</p><p> </p><br />

Ang serving size ng Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter na 2 tablespoons ay naglalaman ng 230 calories, 18 grams ng total fat, at 11% ng protein na kinakailangan ng tao ayon sa FNRI reference para sa adulto. Sa kabila nito, ang Apollo Strawberry Stick Wafer ay hindi nagbibigay ng sapat na nutrisyon sa katawan dahil sa kanyang mababang kontento ng protina at mataas na kontento ng carbs.</p><p></p><p>Ang Pilipinas ay mayroong maraming pagkain na nagbibigay ng mahalagang nutrisyon sa katawan. Ang mga pagkain na ito ay sikat dahil sa kanilang masarap na lasa at affordable na presyo. Ang iba't ibang uri ng prutas at gulay ay karaniwang mabibili sa merkado na nagbibigay ng mga importanteng nutrients sa katawan. Ang mga pagkain na ito ay kasama sa tradisyonal na kultura ng Pilipinas na kinakain sa pang-araw-araw na buhay.</p><p></p><p>Sa konklusyon, ang Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter ay mas nakakabuluhan kaysa sa Apollo Strawberry Stick Wafer dahil sa kanyang mas mataas na nutrisyon content. Ang Pilipinas ay mayroong maraming pagkain na nagbibigay ng mahalagang nutrisyon sa katawan na sikat dahil sa kanilang masarap na lasa at affordable na presyo.
