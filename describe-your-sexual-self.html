                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Several decades of research have identified the contributions of psychosocial influences on adolescent and young adult sexual behavior; however, few studies have examined parental and peer influence and sexual values during the transition from high school to college. The current study tested the influence of sexual values and perceived awareness and caring (PAC), or beliefs about how much parents and peers know and care about students’ behavior, on sexual behavior during this transitional period. Using data from a longitudinal study, generalized estimating equations and the generalized linear model were used to examine the associations among sexual values, parental and peer PAC, and sexual behavior, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Participants (N = 1,847; 61% female) completed web-based surveys the summer before college matriculation and at the end of the first semester in college. Results indicated that individuals with high levels of both parental and peer PAC engaged in less frequent sexual behaviors and that PAC moderated the effect of sexual values on sexual behaviors. Furthermore, both PAC variables decreased during the transition from high school to college, and high school sexual values, parental PAC, and their interaction predicted the number of sexual partners during the first semester of college. Only sexual values and high school unsafe sexual behaviors predicted unsafe sexual behavior in college. Findings suggest that complex associations exist among perceived awareness and caring, sexual values, and sexual behaviors, and that the transition from high school to college may be an ideal time for safer-sex interventions.</p><br />

It is expected that the definition will continue to develop further as the cultural conversation continues to evolve. It is important to remember that any attempts to establish “norms” and an objective definition of sexual health is dangerous in that they could be used to exclude or label people as unhealthy or abnormal.<br /><br />Press the thanks button <br />

Sexual self-concept may be a good predictor of the types of relationships we tend to enter and how we tend to behave within relationships, with a focus on sexual satisfaction, because attachment style moderates one's sense of self in general, as well as one's expectations about and strategies for approaching relationships. </p><p></p><p>These findings advise looking at one's attachment type and comprehending how it may effect involvement with sexual partners as well as <strong>sexual</strong> self-esteem for persons who are single and want to have more sexual fulfillment. Different difficulties arise while trying to maintain sexual self-esteem in the absence of committed relationships. When compared to single people who want to find long-term companions, this is extremely different for individuals who choose to live single lives.</p><p></p><p>Looking at each partner's attachment style and how it manifests in the relationship may help couples who don't experience as much<strong> sexual </strong>fulfillment as they would like to find solutions and increase their level of satisfaction. For instance, if one spouse is avoidant and the other is worried, there could be a vicious cycle where one person tends to their own wants, which makes the other's worry worse. It might be beneficial to sit down and discuss these matters while also thinking about positive methods to approach intimacy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about related the topic, visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5123004 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sexual self-concept refers to the totality of oneself as a sexual being, including positive and negative concepts and feelings. According to theorists, sexual self-concept is described well along three dimensions (Snell &amp; Papini, 1989): sexual self-esteem, sexual depression, and sexual preoccupation.</p><p>Because attachment style moderates one's sense-of-self in general and one's expectations about and strategies for approaching relationships, sexual self-concept may be a good indicator of what kinds of relationships we tend to get into, and how we tend to behave within relationships, with an emphasis on sexual satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>In their recent research paper, "Sexual self-concept, sexual satisfaction, and attachment among single and coupled individuals," authors Anticevic and colleagues (2017) examine the less-well studied intersection of partnering status, attachment style, and sexual self-concept (Pujols, Meston &amp; Seal, 2010).</p><p></p><p>The authors look at a sample of single and coupled adults averaging 35 years of age, ranging from 25 to 45 years of age.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Don't travel by air if you can avoid it because air travel uses up large amounts of fossil fuels and creates greenhouse gases. Dispose of any rubbish responsibly - it can be hazardous to wildlife. Use public transport, cycle or walk instead of using a car. Use facilities and trips run by local people whenever possible.</p><p>It's important because it means understanding all about your body, your feelings, and healthy relationships. It’s about understanding the sexual feelings and attractions we feel towards others. </p><p></p><p>When someone does not understand this aspect well it can cause distress, anxiety, and depression. Your sexuality is central to your self-identity, and not being able to express this is damaging to your sense of self-worth and overall mental health.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po</p><p>Thanks</p><br />
