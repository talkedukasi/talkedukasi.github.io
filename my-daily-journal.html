I leave my 12-hour shift absolutely exhausted especially when I go over worst cases in my head. It is all very scary, to be perfectly honest. It is really a crucial moment for all of us in health care during this time. It is crazy yet so rewarding. We show up strong, united and ready to provide care every single day. But we are also losing staff to sickness or quarantine. "It's been chaotic, people flock outside the ER Just to have their swabs done. We have set up a 'tent city' outside the ER to keep us from being overrun by contagious people. We are triaging to alleviate the pressure on the ER. As ER nurses we cannot lose our cool, we've seen it coming, we come prepared but this one is different." Different and unprecedented, indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on every aspect of life. It has also drawn out the best from many of us and, without doubt, the best and the most from the health-care front-liners. Long after this historic pandemic is over and, God forbid, when an unknown peril lurks again on the dystopian horizon, we will look back at 2020 with awe and gratitude for the health-care front-liners who pulled us from the brink. And hope they would be there again for us as they were, and still are Questions: 2 points each 1. What does the excerpt say about the medical frontliners' situation in the country? 2. How can the situation influence the Filipino medical frontliners? 3. How should the situation be addressed? 4. What Filipino values can be gained from the given text?​</a>

I leave my 12-hour shift absolutely exhausted especially when I go over worst cases in my head. It is all very scary, to be perfectly honest. It is really a crucial moment for all of us in health care during this time. It is crazy yet so rewarding. We show up strong, united and ready to provide care every single day. But we are also losing staff to sickness or quarantine. "It's been chaotic, people flock outside the ER Just to have their swabs done. We have set up a 'tent city' outside the ER to keep us from being overrun by contagious people. We are triaging to alleviate the pressure on the ER. As ER nurses we cannot lose our cool, we've seen it coming, we come prepared but this one is different." Different and unprecedented, indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on every aspect of life. It has also drawn out the best from many of us and, without doubt, the best and the most from the health-care front-liners. Long after this historic pandemic is over and, God forbid, when an unknown peril lurks again on the dystopian horizon, we will look back at 2020 with awe and gratitude for the health-care front-liners who pulled us from the brink. And hope they would be there again for us as they were, and still are Questions: 2 points each 1. What does the excerpt say about the medical frontliners' situation in the country? 2. How can the situation influence the Filipino medical frontliners? 3. How should the situation be addressed? 4. What Filipino values can be gained from the given text?​</h2><br />

What does the excerpt say about the medical frontliners' situation in the country? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>It's hard but rewarding. As we all know, our front-liners are risking everything just to contain the virus and keep everyone safe. As the rest of us are trying to protect ourselves, there are those who are willing to loss their just so you can keep yours. They are suffering already with all the shift and lack of sleep, they are still doing their best. </p><p></p><p>2. How can the situation influence the Filipino medical frontliners? </p><p><strong>Answer:  </strong>I believe that the situation made them stronger and more ready. If they overcome this pandemic, there is no reason for them not overcome the future peril.</p><p></p><p>3. How should the situation be addressed? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Our frontliners must be given the support that they deserved. Our government must also be ready at all times and have emergency funds so that our country won't go into chaos whenever anything unexpected and unwanted happens.</p><p></p><p>4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I woke up at 5.00am this morning after a decent rest. I felt energetic because I slept early yesterday at around 9pm. I jumped out of bed and tidied my room saving time for my morning jog. Later I went down stairs and found mum already up and watching her favorite morning sermon on television. I greeted her and asked for my brother: he was still asleep; he is not as hardworking as I am. I took the dog and told mom I was going jogging. Once out of the gate I started jogging slowly into the nearby park where my friends and I go jogging every morning and on weekends. I had jogged for about half an hour when I met Cindy one of my friend in society</p><p>I was Jogging, It happened to meet one of my neighbors and friend Cindy. We related extremely well as friends since childhood, and this interaction is what brought us together. Relating to people around us is what makes us human; we can be termed as social beings. Organization is what describes the role of doing things in a social group (Eubank, 1932); I followed my daily routine of waking up, tidying up, jogging and getting ready for work in an orderly way so that things done in the house and by other family members would not be affected. After jogging, I dressed up to look neat and maintain my image in the community. Mom had made breakfast for us before we went to school that was her duty to the family, and she expected all of us at the table for breakfast. We took breakfast as an institution; institutions involved the arrangements done by human beings in interaction with each other and regularly just like we did every morning for breakfast. School was mandatory, and that was another step in life that I had to complete in order to find my place in the community. I rushed to school; a place that gave me identity and gave me with knowledge. Going to school made me motivated, responsible, and focused and I needed to be a successful individual in my society. School was also not just a learning institution, but it gave me the identity.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong.</p><p></p><br />
