The parent supports the child by exercising authority and through consistent, empathic, appropriate behavior in response to the child's needs. PARENTING differs from CHILD REARING in that in child rearing the emphasis is on the act of training or bringing up the children and the interaction between the parent and child, while parenting emphasizes the responsibility and qualities of exemplary behavior of the parent.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is COVID-19?   COVID-19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019, a mild to severe respiratory illness. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p><p></p><p></p><p>How is COVID-19 transmitted?   COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through contact with infectious material, particularly respiratory droplets that enter the environment when an infected person sneezes or coughs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>How do vaccines work? Are there certain types of vaccine models that are more effective?    Vaccines work by imitating infection to encourage the body to produce antibodies against infectious agents.</p><p></p><p></p><p>how are vaccines actually distributed?  Ensuring that vaccines are distributed across the globe—especially to populations in greatest need—depends on multiple factors, particularly supply and logistics. Once vaccines are manufactured, they typically move from factory to national storage facility to regional storage facilities and then to hospitals and health clinics that have requested the vaccine, where they are administered to individuals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What would it take for a population to get herd immunity to COVID-19?      When an individual becomes infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the body produces antibodies that neutralize the virus to prevent it from causing further harm to cells and tissues.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What are key recovery symptoms following COVID-19 infection and successful treatment?  The percentage of a population that needs to develop immunity to an infectious disease in order for herd immunity to take effect depends on the contagiousness of the disease.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What can I do to protect myself (and others) from the virus?  Survivors of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly those who were hospitalized, are likely to suffer long-term effects.</p><p></p><p></p><p>How much of the population will the coronavirus pandemic actually affect?   The best way to protect yourself against coronavirus infection is to wash your hands. Handwashing with soap and water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds followed by thorough rinsing and drying, clears your skin of viruses that may be on your hands.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why are older adults and those with underlying illness at greatest risk of COVID-19 infection?   While it is difficult to estimate just how many people will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that a significant proportion of the world's population will be infected in the coming months.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why can’t we use a disinfectant to fight a virus once it’s in our body?  Disinfectants are not to be used internally and can cause great damage to the human body if ingested or injected.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
