                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Padre Faura's poem</p><p></p><p>While reading the poem, I felt a variety of emotions but what stood out was sadness. Imagine having someone close to you, someone you consider like a child, be executed in front of you. There could the feeling of guilt for not being able to do anything, there could be the feeling of anger towards those who want your loved one executed but sadness really prevails. The sadness of not being able to see them or hear them talk anymore.</p><p></p><p>More about the poem:</p><p></p><p>The poem began by expressing Padre Faura's thoughts and sentiments on the morning of Rizal's execution, which occurred early in the morning. Padre Faura was shivering in his robes. Afterward, he related an incident that occurred between him and Jose Rizal in the Manila Obeservatory, during which Jose Rizal inquired about Purgatory.</p><p></p><p>After that, he described Rizal's mental condition and mood just before his execution. He stated that Rizal's cheeks were still red despite everything that he had been through at the time of the incident.
