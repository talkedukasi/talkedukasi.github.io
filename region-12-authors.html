PASSAGE:
Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi 
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
 In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.

"Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'" Developing sensitivity Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.QUESTIONS:1. What does the author's use to get her point across?​</a>

Mayon Volcano Eruption22 January 2018OCHASituation OverviewOn 22 January 2018, alert level 4 (hazardous eruption imminent) was raised over Mayon Volcanolocated in Albay province, 300 km southeast of Manila. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology andSeismology (PHIVOLCS) raised the alert level after a 10 km high ash column spewed out of thevolcano at around 12:45 p.m. Alert level-3 (increased tendency to hazardous eruption) on a five-step alert system has been in effect since 14 January, when a phreatic eruption ejected ash andsulphur fumes accompanied by rumbling sounds. On 15 January, two eruptions caused the collapseof the lava dome that produced rock falls and small-volume pyroclastic flows. Sulfur dioxide gasemission was measured at an average of 689 tons/day on 21 January.The danger zone has been extended to an 8 km radius, up from a previous 7 km where localauthorities were advised to prevent any human activity due to the danger of rockfalls, landslides andsudden explosions or dome collapse that may generate hazardous volcanic flows. Civil aviationauthorities are also advising pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano's summit. Aside from theeruption danger, lahar or mudflow is a threat especially during heavy rains, which have beenreported in the region, according to a PHIVOLCS press briefing on 22 January.As of 22 January, 7,900 families (30,000 people) have evacuated from seven Albay municipalitiesneighbouring Mount Mayon and are temporarily sheltered in 27 evacuations centres or are beinghosted by relatives and friends. The number of evacuees is expected to increase as localgovernments are currently evacuating villages within the extended eight-kilometre danger zone,including residents from Legazpi City who returned to their places of origin last week after pre-emptive evacuation, even though their community was outside the 6 km danger zone.Source: https://reliefweh.int/report/philippines/ocha-flash-update-nol-philippines-mayon-volcano-eruption-22-january-2018​</a>

                                            PASSAGE:Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy By Sara Goudarzi  If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."Teen thinking In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"Developing sensitivityChildren start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five.

                                            “Study shows Urbanization’s Impact on Biodiversity”
By Mark Kinver
Science and Environment Reporter, BBC News, 12 February 2014
A dataset, described as the largest of its kind to date, has assessed the impact of urbanization on biodiversity levels around the globe. It found that cities supported far fewer species of birds and plants compared with similar areas of undeveloped land.
However, it showed the vast majority of flora and fauna in a city reflected an area's "unique biotic heritage". Green spaces provide an "important refuge" for native and migratory species, the team observed.
"While we show that urbanization has caused cities to lose large numbers of plants and animals, the good news is that cities still retain endemic native species, which opens the door for new policies on regional and global biodiversity conservation," said co-author Myla Aronson, a research scientist from Rutgers University, in the US state of New Jersey.
"In particular, the study highlights the value of green spaces in cities, which have become important refuges for native species and migrating wildlife." The international team of researchers collected lists of plants in 110 cities and lists of birds found in 54 cities around the world.
"We were interested in plants and birds that were found in all parts of the city - from buildings, roads, vacant lots, brownfields, managed green spaces and natural green spaces - to understand how cities support biodiversity as a whole," Dr. Aronson told BBC News…

It follows many other countries in expanding its immunisation drive to minors. Authorities plan a pilot run of a return to face-to-face classes in up to 120 schools next month. The Philippines -33) was among 17 countries globally where schools have been closed for the entirety of the pandemic, according to a September report by the United Nations children's d. it can agency UNICEF. "For me, I'm looking forward to getting back to face-to-face classes nd other in the future," said Gyle Fernandez, 17, one of more than 1,000 children who received 7 million their vaccinations on Friday. The Philippines is prioritising 1.2 million children with Ehold existing health conditions and has approved two vaccine brands for minors. Of its 2.7 ia and million confirmed COVID-19 cases, 7.8% affect young people aged 10-19 years old. over Fatalities among that bracket are comparatively lower, making up 0.6% of the country's more than 40,000 deaths. The Philippines reported 7,625 new coronavirus infections on Friday, among the lowest in two months. New cases fell to a daily average of 10.500 this month compared to nearly 19,000 in September. Jacquelyn Dannug, 40, said she wanted her child, 12, to have protection. "It would be difficult as we are often outside and she could possibly get infected if she is not fully vaccinated," said Dannug, standing beside her daughter. The Philippines will further stare det-elax coronavirus restrictions in the Manila region starting from Saturday. It has so far imental vaccinated nearly 24 million of its 110 million population. -tion Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Susan Fenton air pollution​</h2><br />

PASSAGE:  Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy   By Sara Goudarzi      If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."  Teen thinking   In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"  Developing sensitivity  Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.        Question:   Why did the author mention ‘hormonal shift’ in the article?

Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.

If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study.

                            24. Study : Teenage brain lacks empathy By Sara Goudarzi If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)." Teen thinking In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'" Developing sensitivity Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.QUESTIONS:1. What does the author's use to get her point across?​</h2><br />

                            29. “Study shows Urbanization’s Impact on Biodiversity”
By Mark Kinver
Science and Environment Reporter, BBC News, 12 February 2014
A dataset, described as the largest of its kind to date, has assessed the impact of urbanization on biodiversity levels around the globe. It found that cities supported far fewer species of birds and plants compared with similar areas of undeveloped land.
However, it showed the vast majority of flora and fauna in a city reflected an area's "unique biotic heritage". Green spaces provide an "important refuge" for native and migratory species, the team observed.
"While we show that urbanization has caused cities to lose large numbers of plants and animals, the good news is that cities still retain endemic native species, which opens the door for new policies on regional and global biodiversity conservation," said co-author Myla Aronson, a research scientist from Rutgers University, in the US state of New Jersey.
"In particular, the study highlights the value of green spaces in cities, which have become important refuges for native species and migrating wildlife." The international team of researchers collected lists of plants in 110 cities and lists of birds found in 54 cities around the world.
"We were interested in plants and birds that were found in all parts of the city - from buildings, roads, vacant lots, brownfields, managed green spaces and natural green spaces - to understand how cities support biodiversity as a whole," Dr. Aronson told BBC News…
