When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor. It's 250,000 miles away. It's gravity is only 1/6that of Earth. This means a boy weighing 120 pounds in Virginia would weigh only 20pounds on the moon. In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</a>

1. "The idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in black, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on the dingy boats, on the yellow river--clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the passers-by."
An excerpt from Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills
2. Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.
Animal Farm A Fairy Story by George Orwell
3. In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.
Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes
4. Depression is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. It is normal to feel sad once in a while but if you are sad most of the time and it affects your daily life, you may have clinical depression. It's a condition you can treat with medicine, talking to a therapist, and changes to your lifestyle.

Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring. Animal Farm A Fairy Story by George Orwell 3. In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.

Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>l.The force of friction opposes the motion of an object, causing moving objects to lose energy and slow down. When objects move through a fluid, such as air or water, the fluid exerts a frictional force on the moving object. The frictional force from a fluid is called a drag force.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>heheh yan lang yung alam ko btw parehas tayo ng tanong</p><br />

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal.

Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor. It's 250,000 miles away. It's gravity is only 1/6that of Earth. This means a boy weighing 120 pounds in Virginia would weigh only 20pounds on the moon.

1. "The idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in black, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on the dingy boats, on the yellow river--clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the passers-by."
An excerpt from Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills
2. Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.
Animal Farm A Fairy Story by George Orwell
3. In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.
Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes
4. Depression is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. It is normal to feel sad once in a while but if you are sad most of the time and it affects your daily life, you may have clinical depression. It's a condition you can treat with medicine, talking to a therapist, and changes to your lifestyle.

Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.

In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.
