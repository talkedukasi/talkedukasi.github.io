At the same moment, Maria was also reaching towards the same piece of animal skin and their souls accidentally touched.______2. At that time people could talk with the deities face to face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree.______3. Unfortunately, Gat Dula’s inability to see Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria implored the gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted.______4. According to a legend, there was a time when the gods could live like ordinary mortals do.______5. When Maria went to the market, she was always accompanied by two Aetas, who serve as her servants.______6. Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula.______7. It was the custom of Maria to go to a small market, called talipapa, on weekdays.______8. Gat Panahon was angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria’s mother, was distressed that her only daughter was inlove with a mortal.______9. Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was the delight of her parents.______10. Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth.______11. Since that first encounter, Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he was not able to see Maria during these visits.______12. But even though Maria and Gat Dula could no longer meet physically, their love endured.______13. One day, he saw Maria at the very place where they first met. He approached Maria and greeted her and Maria responded with a very sweet smile.______14. That was the beginning of their friendship which blossomed into love as time passed.______15. One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom of Bay, came to talipapa to while away the hours.​</a>

                                            1. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. Water dripped slowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky. The shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time.What is the main idea? a. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed b. Before clocks were made, people kept track by other means. c. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. d. All the above. 2. (1) One common example of instinct is the spider's spinning of its intricate web. (2) No one teaches a spider how to spin: its inborn instinct allows it to accomplish the task. (3) Another example of instinctive behavior is the salmon's struggle to swim upstream to lay eggs. (4) It would be much easier for the salmon to follow the current downstream, but instinct overrides all other considerations. (5) Instinct is clearly a strong influence on animal behavior.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Senior high school or SHS refers to the last two years of the K to 12 program that has been implemented by the Department of Education here in the Philippines since 2012 – namely, grades 11 and 12. Students are now required to choose their preferred senior high strands upon their entrance and to begin studying the subjects that are going to introduce them to the career path that they want to take.</p><p></p><p>In the old system here in our county, high school education consisted of the first year up to the fourth year. Today, those four years correspond to Grades 7 to 10, otherwise known as junior high school or JHS. It should be noted that currently “senior high” no longer just means the very last year of high school but rather, the two grade levels after it. Likewise, “junior high” also does not just mean the year before the last of high school but rather the four grade levels under senior high.</p><p></p><p>Under Republic Act No. 10533 or the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, students are now required to complete Kindergarten, Grades 1 to 6 or elementary school, Grades 7 to 10 or junior high school, and Grades 11 to 12 or senior high school. All of this must be completed in 13 years before a student can receive his or her high school diploma.</p><p></p><p>Upon enrollment in senior high school, students are also going to have to pick among four senior high strands or tracks. Choosing the right strand is one of the biggest decisions a student in the Philippines is going to have to make, so read on and find out how you can best make this choice.</p><br />

                            20. 1. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. Water dripped slowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky. The shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time.What is the main idea? a. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed b. Before clocks were made, people kept track by other means. c. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. d. All the above. 2. (1) One common example of instinct is the spider's spinning of its intricate web. (2) No one teaches a spider how to spin: its inborn instinct allows it to accomplish the task. (3) Another example of instinctive behavior is the salmon's struggle to swim upstream to lay eggs. (4) It would be much easier for the salmon to follow the current downstream, but instinct overrides all other considerations. (5) Instinct is clearly a strong influence on animal behavior.

(1) In response to customers' bitter complaints about long lines, banks are trying new ways to shorten the wait or at least to make it more pleasant.

(4) One daring bank in California will pay a customer five dollars if he or she must wait more than five minutes for service.
