Paste a picture of you when you were in Elementary, High School, and now that
you are in college. Below each picture, list down your significant characteristics during
that time.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:For anyone who is wondering, salient means the most important characteristics that tend to define you as an individual. (At least, in this instance.). I don’t think they change a great deal, just get more ingrained with maturity. A sense of self worth. An accepting attitude towards authority. The desire to excel, or at least, do well. The ability to use your time wisely, and to my mind, a friendly, non judgemental attitude to others. With these, you achieve success in school, and are a welcome member of any group.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

I was indeed a joyful fellow who knew not that much of the world. Everything was sunshine and Rainbow and as a kid in my position, it wasn't a surprise. <br /><br />Moving onto High school, the stage of changes and growing up into a young adult. Firstly, it started of me becoming rebellious towards others in that stage. I was no longer shy and had confidence. I was becoming more into academics and strived to be successful. <br /><br />Now that I am a proud College student, my characteristics haven't changed since then. My interests in life and academics barely moved and now I am as happy as I can be!<br /><br />Hope that helps! Keep on Learning! #Brainliest</p><br />
