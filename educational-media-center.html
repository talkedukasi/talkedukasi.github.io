                                            what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</a>

diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs.

You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem.

The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open.

                            18. what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</h2><br />

You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher.
2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was
diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.</h2><br />
