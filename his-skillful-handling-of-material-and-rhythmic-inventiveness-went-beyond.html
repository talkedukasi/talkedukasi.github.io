                                            4. Before the spread of Gutenberg's idea, literature was handwritten. That means that each copythe bible and all its 73 books were tediously hand scribed, and this was done before the inventionof the ballpoint pen. Given the amount of detail that went into each text, creating a single copy ofa bible could take years. Because of the effort that went into producing them, books wereextremely rare and valuable. Because of the value of books, there was little reason for commonpeople to learn to read or write since it was unlikely that they would ever handle a book in theirlifetimes. Gutenberg's invention would change that. His printing press allowed literature to beproduced on a mass scale. His movable metal type could be arranged once to form a page, andhe could print the page again and again,Summary:​</a>

                        <p>JJ Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897 was a major breakthrough in the understanding of the atomic structure. He discovered that cathode rays, which were previously thought to be a type of wave, were actually made up of tiny, negatively charged particles called electrons. This led him to propose a new model for the structure of the atom, known as the plum pudding model, which suggested that the atom was composed of a positively charged substance with electrons embedded in it.</p><p></p><p>Thomson's work also led to the invention of the mass spectrograph, which is a device used to analyze the mass and abundance of different isotopes in a sample. The mass spectrograph works by ionizing the atoms in the sample, then separating them according to their mass-to-charge ratio, and finally detecting the resulting ion beams.</p><p></p><p>The invention of the mass spectrograph was significant because it allowed scientists to study the properties of atoms and molecules in more detail, including their mass, composition, and isotopic abundance. This, in turn, led to the development of new fields of study, such as nuclear physics and isotopic geochemistry, and has had important practical applications in areas such as medical research and environmental monitoring.</p><br />
