                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When entrepreneurs don't consider their responsibilities and obligations to the wider society or community, it can have negative consequences for their business in the long term.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, such behavior can lead to a loss of reputation and trust among customers and stakeholders. If a business is seen as neglecting its responsibilities towards society, it may be perceived as unethical, and people may choose not to do business with it. This can result in a decrease in sales and revenue, ultimately impacting the profitability and sustainability of the business.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, neglecting social responsibilities can also result in legal and regulatory issues. In many jurisdictions, businesses are required to comply with certain laws and regulations related to environmental protection, consumer protection, labor standards, and other social responsibilities. Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to fines, legal action, and damage to the reputation of the business.</p><p></p><p>Finally, not considering social responsibilities can also lead to negative impacts on the broader community or environment. This can result in public backlash, protests, and calls for boycotts or other actions that can harm the business.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to consider their responsibilities and obligations towards society and the community as a whole, not just for ethical reasons, but also for the long-term sustainability and success of their business</p><br />
