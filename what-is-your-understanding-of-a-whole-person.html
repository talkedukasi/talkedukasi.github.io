BTW  here's the title"The Senior High School, Home Economics Students’ Struggles and Adjustments During Face to Face Mode of Education sy 2022-2023"•What are the things to consider when making a Methodology for a Quantitative Research? •And what is a Z-test? I wanna know why z-test got recommended to us? how should it be used? Our teacher said to use z-test because our research is about comparing 2 sample groups that will answer our survey questionnaires.Teacher doesnt even know how to explain how to use Z-test, that's why I'm asking this.•If Z-test is a formula pls explain it.Our questionnaires has categories like thesefor example:Name:___   Section:__         Direction: check the box if the sentence coincides with your situationSTRUGGLESPersonal [  ] Having to deal with all of my problem only by myself [  ] Losing time for my hobbies [  ] The changes in my life have brought me negativity[  ] My problems just keep on growing[  ] Stressed by many thingsEmotional[  ] I'm not familiar with dealing with my emotions[  ] Stress overwhelms me[  ] I let hatred and pleasure influence my actions[  ] I hide my emotions [  ] My sadness prevents me from doing anythingIntellectual [  ] Unprepared to deal with problems[  ] It’s difficult to make my own choice[  ] Having a hard time with learning and understanding lessons [  ] I’m too shy/prideful to ask the teacher about the things I don’t understand[  ] It’s hard to make a decision○Adjustments ○(our group is not done with these so just use your imagination)Personal [  ] Give time for myself[  ] Try to Open up to people[  ] [  ] [  ] Emotional[  ] Learn how to handle emotions[  ] Understand that I'm not alone in my struggles[  ] [  ] [  ] Intellectual [  ] Search Google for answers.[  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] Ask smart or experienced people for advice.•Will the use of z-test get more complicated?Because there's even more topics; 6 of them on both sides of Struggles and Adjustments. Those topics also have 5 sentences under each of them•Should we decrease the topics and sentences inorder for it to be easier to do and explain? We will probably have to put it on a chart and explain it while also defending it. ;') pray for us​</a>

                                            i Badly need your help po Write agree or disagree with the statement. And write a short explanation.1. In attempting to understand human beings, one should stick to what can be directly observed and avoid theory or concepts that cannot be seen or observed. 2. Events taking place in the present are systematically linked to events that have occurred in one’s past. 3. A specific piece of human behavior cannot be understood without considering the person and his or her life as a whole.
 4. People are basically good (as opposed to evil or neutral). If left to a natural state without external controls, they will seek health and personal growth while respecting the rights of others to do the same. 5. A person’s character is largely determined before he or she reaches adulthood. The only real changes that one can expect from an adult are relatively small ones, and these occur slowly over long periods of time. 6. General laws of behavior and experience that apply to all people are not very helpful if you want to understand a particular individual.7. Much of behavior, both conscious and unconscious, is directed by unconscious impulses and motivations.
8. Aggression is an inherent and inescapable part of human nature.9. People are capable of making major and lasting changes in themselves within a relatively brief period of time.
10. Human behavior can be understood as a continuous attempt to increase pleasure and avoid pain and discomfort.​</a>

Adopting a whole person approach to development means recognizing that true professional development is indeed personal, and that in order for an employee to truly lead and improve others, they must develop as a whole person. Whole person development is the ability for someone to know themselves, know how to improve themselves, know others, and know how to help others improve.<br />

What kind of language is used by poets and writers in describing persons or their feelings dramatically? 4. What is the meaning and effect of the following lines found in the poems "sweet despair" (Spring) and "suavely merciless" ("The White Doe"). In addition, how does the meaning of "suavely merciless" connect with lines 7 to 8 of the poem "The White Doe"? 5. What kind of language is used by poets and writers in forming contradiction that often expresses conflicting feelings? 6. What kind of poem are Petrarch's three poems?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Petrarch used various images to compare Laura, such as a sun, an angel, a star, and a goddess.Petrarch described his feelings as intense grief and despair when Laura died. He used emotional and dramatic language to convey his sorrow.Poets and writers often use vivid and sensory language, such as metaphors, similes, and personification, to describe persons or their feelings dramatically. They also use emotive and expressive language to create a certain mood or tone."Sweet despair" and "suavely merciless" are oxymorons, which are contradictions that express conflicting feelings. "Suavely merciless" in "The White Doe" means that the pursuit of the beautiful and pure is both alluring and cruel, which connects with lines 7 to 8 that suggest the speaker is drawn to the doe's beauty but is also aware of its potential to harm him. The oxymorons create a sense of tension and complexity in the language.Poets and writers use paradoxes and oxymorons to form contradictions that often express conflicting feelings, such as love and hate, joy and sorrow, and life and death. They use this language to create a sense of tension and complexity in the text.Petrarch's three poems are sonnets, which are 14-line poems that follow a specific rhyme scheme and structure. They are usually written in iambic pentameter and are known for their expressive and emotive language.<p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>The methodology of a quantitative research is the set of procedures and techniques used to conduct the research. When designing a methodology for your research, you should consider the following:</p><p></p><p>The research question or problem: What is it that you want to study? What is the research question or problem that you are trying to answer or solve?</p><p></p><p>The research design: How will you go about answering the research question or problem? Will you use a survey, an experiment, a case study, or some other research design?</p><p></p><p>The sampling method: How will you select the participants for your study? Will you use a random sample, a convenience sample, or some other sampling method?</p><p></p><p>The data collection method: How will you collect data from your participants? Will you use questionnaires, interviews, observations, or some other method?</p><p></p><p>The data analysis method: How will you analyze the data that you collect? Will you use statistical techniques like the Z-test, regression analysis, or ANOVA?</p><p></p><p>A Z-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the mean of a sample to a known population mean. It is often used when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is known. In your research, you can use the Z-test to compare the mean scores of the two sample groups (e.g., those who struggled and those who made adjustments) on each of the topics (e.g., personal, emotional, intellectual).</p><p></p><p>To use the Z-test, you will need to calculate the Z-score for each sample group on each topic. The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a sample mean is from the population mean. If the Z-scores are significantly different from each other (e.g., if the p-value is less than 0.05), then you can conclude that there is a significant difference between the two sample groups on that topic.</p><p></p><p>It may be helpful to reduce the number of topics and sentences if the research becomes too complicated to understand and explain. However, it's important to keep in mind that reducing the number of topics and sentences may also reduce the validity and reliability of your research.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story by Jack London explores the relationship between a man and a dog and the theme of survival. To test how cold it is, the man takes off his glove and can feel just how cold it is. The antagonist in the story is the harsh cold environment. When the man starts his third fire, his dog lays close beside it and the man understands how much his companion means to him. The man's idea of a dog is one who is loyal and understanding. A good word to describe the man is resilient as he finds ways to survive despite the treacherous environment. The man's main fear on his trip is being alone and not being able to make it back home. He makes mistakes in not understanding travelling alone, the dangers he faces, and not listening to people but he does not make a mistake in trusting his dog. The story is a heartbreaking reminder of the strength of the human spirit and the power of loyalty and friendship. My personal reaction to the story is one of sadness.</p><br />
