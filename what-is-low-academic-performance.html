                                            Why Duterte must own up to the Philippines’ COVID-19 disaster
Richard Heydrian is an Asia-based academic, columnist and author of “The
Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy” and the ‘ The Indo-
Pacific: Trump, China and the New Struggle for Global Mastery.”
No stranger to crisis and natural disasters, the Philippines’ response to
major calamities has long been hampered by weak institutions and a notoriously
corrupt bureaucracy. But President Rodrigo Duterte’s disastrous management of
the COVID-19 pandemic has struck a new low.
After imposing one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns enforced by
the military, the Philippines stands out as one of the region’s hot spots.
In many ways, this was a disaster waiting to happen. Elected on the promise
of bringing about “real change.’ Duterte’s populist crisis management style has
been bedeviled by a toxic combination of erratic leadership and authoritarian
excess.
Despite the strenuous efforts of top officials to downplay the crisis, the
Philippines’ number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has surpassed even far more
populous nations such as China and Indonesia. Among Asia-Pacific countries, only
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have it worse.
And thanks to an overly strict lockdown which shuttered up to 75% of
economic activity- but still failed to halt the spread of the virus- Philippines just
posted its worst quarterly economic performance on record, with the economy
shrinking 16.5% in the three months to end of June compared to robust growth of
5.4% for the same period last year.
7
The impact on everyday life has been severe with recent Department of Trade
and Industry survey showing that up to a third of businesses had been forced to
close down and unemployment reaching a historic high of 17.7% in April.
Many cities now forced back into even stricter lockdowns after the surge in
coronavirus cases and its far from clear how the Philippine economy will rebound
as the unprecedented magnitude that has overwhelmed the country’s health care
system and wipe out decades worth of gains poverty and underemployment.

                                            Headaches can have several causes. One obvious case is stress. People have hectic lives and frequently have multiple stressors every day, like work, family and money. Another reason for headaches in some people has to do with diet. Some get headaches because they are dependent on caffeine. Other people may be allergic to salt, or they may have low blood sugar. The environment can also cause this uncomfortable condition. Allergens such as household chemicals including polishes, waxes, bug killers, and paint can lead to headaches. Lowering stress, controlling your diet and avoiding allergens can help avoid headaches. 1. What is the text about? 2.  What are the signal words used to express cause and effect?3.

                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                        <p><strong>The following are the answers to these questions.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1) What is Personal Traits / Values Needed Of Low Academic Performance?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Personal values or personality traits that can be developed by students with a poor academic record include:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Self-motivation – Students who have been unsuccessful in school may lack self motivation, which means they do not see themselves as capable of succeeding academically. They need to learn how to motivate themselves through their own efforts rather than rely on others to provide this for them. This will help them develop an inner drive towards success.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Persistence – A student's persistence is another important trait he needs if he has failed at something before. He must realize that there is no point giving up because you don't succeed immediately. Instead, he should work hard until he succeeds. If he does give up, then his failure becomes even more severe.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Positive thinking – Many people think negative thoughts about themselves when things go wrong. However, positive thinking helps one overcome problems and achieve goals. Therefore, students who fail often tend to blame other factors such as teachers, parents, etc., but seldom look within themselves. To change this mindset, they need to focus on developing positive attitudes toward life.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Responsibility – It takes responsibility to accept your failures and move forward from them. When we take full responsibility for our actions, we become responsible adults. We also gain confidence and respect from others.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Time management skills – Successful time managers know how much time each task requires and manage their time accordingly. For example, some tasks require less effort while others require a lot of energy. In order to complete all assignments successfully, students must understand how long different activities will take and plan ahead so that they finish everything well before deadlines.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  * Goal setting – Having clear goals and objectives is essential for any individual. Without goals, individuals cannot accomplish anything; therefore, goal setting plays a very important role in achieving success.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2) What Is Action Required From Student With Poor Academic Record?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Action required from students with a poor academic record includes:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  1. Developing good study habits - Students with poor grades usually find studying difficult. As a result, they procrastinate and make excuses why they haven't studied yet. These reasons range from "I'm too tired" to "My teacher doesn't like me." The truth is that most students feel bad about failing and try to avoid doing homework. So, they end up making excuses instead of working harder. By avoiding studying, students miss out on opportunities to improve their grades.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  2. Taking initiative – Most students with poor grades believe that someone else is going to solve their problem for them. But, taking initiative shows courage and character. You'll never get anywhere without trying!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  3. Being persistent – Failure comes easily to many students. Because of this, they lose hope quickly and stop believing in themselves. On the contrary, those who persist despite setbacks eventually succeed.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  4. Learning how to deal with stress – Stress makes us act irrationally. Some students cope with stress by using alcohol or drugs. Others resort to violence or stealing. Still others use unhealthy ways to relieve stress including eating junk food or watching television. Whatever method they choose, students who suffer from stress are unlikely to perform well in class.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  5. Adopting a healthy lifestyle – Eating right, exercising regularly, sleeping enough hours every night, getting adequate rest, and having regular bowel movements are just some of the health practices that contribute to overall wellness. Healthier lifestyles lead to better mental clarity and concentration.

                            13. Why Duterte must own up to the Philippines’ COVID-19 disaster
Richard Heydrian is an Asia-based academic, columnist and author of “The
Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy” and the ‘ The Indo-
Pacific: Trump, China and the New Struggle for Global Mastery.”
No stranger to crisis and natural disasters, the Philippines’ response to
major calamities has long been hampered by weak institutions and a notoriously
corrupt bureaucracy. But President Rodrigo Duterte’s disastrous management of
the COVID-19 pandemic has struck a new low.
After imposing one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns enforced by
the military, the Philippines stands out as one of the region’s hot spots.
In many ways, this was a disaster waiting to happen. Elected on the promise
of bringing about “real change.’ Duterte’s populist crisis management style has
been bedeviled by a toxic combination of erratic leadership and authoritarian
excess.
Despite the strenuous efforts of top officials to downplay the crisis, the
Philippines’ number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has surpassed even far more
populous nations such as China and Indonesia. Among Asia-Pacific countries, only
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have it worse.
And thanks to an overly strict lockdown which shuttered up to 75% of
economic activity- but still failed to halt the spread of the virus- Philippines just
posted its worst quarterly economic performance on record, with the economy
shrinking 16.5% in the three months to end of June compared to robust growth of
5.4% for the same period last year.
7
The impact on everyday life has been severe with recent Department of Trade
and Industry survey showing that up to a third of businesses had been forced to
close down and unemployment reaching a historic high of 17.7% in April.
Many cities now forced back into even stricter lockdowns after the surge in
coronavirus cases and its far from clear how the Philippine economy will rebound
as the unprecedented magnitude that has overwhelmed the country’s health care
system and wipe out decades worth of gains poverty and underemployment.

                            14. Headaches can have several causes. One obvious case is stress. People have hectic lives and frequently have multiple stressors every day, like work, family and money. Another reason for headaches in some people has to do with diet. Some get headaches because they are dependent on caffeine. Other people may be allergic to salt, or they may have low blood sugar. The environment can also cause this uncomfortable condition. Allergens such as household chemicals including polishes, waxes, bug killers, and paint can lead to headaches. Lowering stress, controlling your diet and avoiding allergens can help avoid headaches. 1. What is the text about? 2.  What are the signal words used to express cause and effect?3.

                            15. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement
