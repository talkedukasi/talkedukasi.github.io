                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

For more than 300 years, Spanish was the official language in the country under Spanish rule. 60% of the population spoke Spanish as either a first, second or third language in the early 20th century. But after the American occupation in the early 1900’s, the use of Spanish began to decline. In 1935, the Constitution of the Philippines named English and Spanish the official languages. In 1939, the Tagalog language was named the national language. It was renamed “Pilipino” in 1959 and finally “Filipino” in 1973.  The present Constitution names Filipino and English as joint official languages.</strong></p><br />

With the current trends and popular culture today, how do you see a Filipino? Cite specific examples. 5. Why do you think it was said that politics is about power sharing and power struggle? What are the manifestations of this statement in our society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Social Science as a discipline provides various frameworks, concepts, and tools that can be utilized to address present-day problems in the community. By understanding the human behavior and social processes that shape our society, we can analyze the causes and consequences of current issues and develop solutions that are effective and sustainable. In summary, Social Science provides a valuable lens through which we can understand and address present-day problems in our community. By utilizing its frameworks, concepts, and tools, we can develop strategies that are evidence-based, effective, and sustainable.E.B. Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" means that culture is composed of various interconnected components such as beliefs, values, practices, and material artifacts that form a coherent system. Applying this definition to Philippine society, we can understand the diverse and complex nature of Philippine culture. In the Philippines, culture is shaped by a variety of factors such as history, religion, language, and geography. The country's rich history of colonization, trade, and migration has resulted in a diverse mix of cultures and influences, which have been integrated into the fabric of Filipino society. In summary, Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" is useful in understanding Philippine society as a diverse and interconnected system shaped by a variety of historical, cultural, and social factors.Firstly, understanding political science concepts such as governance, democracy, and civil society can equip individuals with the knowledge to participate in civic activities, such as voting, advocacy, and community organizing. By participating in these activities, individuals can practice their civic skills, such as critical thinking, public speaking, and leadership, while promoting humane ideals such as social justice, equality, and human rights. Secondly, studying political science can also help individuals develop a critical understanding of the political system and its impact on society. This can lead to a greater awareness of social and political issues, and a deeper empathy for the experiences of marginalized groups. With this knowledge, individuals can use their voice to advocate for the rights and well-being of these groups, and work towards creating a more just and equitable society. Finally, political science can also provide individuals with a global perspective on political issues and events. By studying politics in other countries, individuals can gain an appreciation for diverse cultures and ways of life, and develop a sense of global citizenship. This can lead to a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of political issues, and a deeper commitment to promoting peace and cooperation among nations.In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of Filipino music and dance, with Filipino artists gaining international recognition. Additionally, traditional Filipino dance, such as the Tinikling and the Singkil, has gained recognition and popularity in international dance competitions. Filipino cuisine has also gained popularity worldwide, with Filipino dishes like adobo, sinigang, and halo-halo becoming more widely known and appreciated. In terms of fashion and beauty, there has been a growing interest in Filipino textiles and fashion, with designers incorporating traditional Filipino fabrics and styles into their designs.Politics is often said to be about power sharing and power struggle because it involves the distribution and exercise of power among individuals and groups within a society. Those who hold power may seek to maintain it, while those who do not may seek to gain it. This struggle for power can manifest in various ways in our society. Another manifestation of power struggle in politics is the tension between different branches of government. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government may have different interests and priorities, which can result in conflicts and power struggles as each branch tries to assert its influence and control over government functions. Furthermore, power struggles can also occur within and between social groups in society. For example, there may be conflicts between labor unions and business owners over worker rights and wages. There may also be struggles between different ethnic or religious groups over political representation or access to resources.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>douitashimashite</p><br />

                            15. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />
