                                            Directions: Read the text carefully and analyze how sound is produced. Using the jumbled letters in Activity A, write the correct sequence of sound production in human voice box using flow chart.Sound is produced when an object vibrates, creating a pressure wave. This pressure wave causes particles in the surrounding medium (air, water, or solid) to have vibrational motion. As the particles vibrate, they move nearby particles, transmitting the sound further through the medium. The human voice uses several types of sound production and modification mechanisms. The vocal cords located in the larynx (or voice box) in the throat are the primary producers of sound for singing and for spoken vowels. The cords vibrate and produce pressure pulses when air is blown through them.Jumbled Word from Activity A : Energy, Force, Vibration, Sound, Larynx Thx po</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for transporting nutrients throughout their bodies and removing wastes. The human circulatory system has a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the body. This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste compounds</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I don't know if that is correct I just search that to </p><p>beacuse your question is so long good luck I hope it helps ☺️</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            6. Directions: Read the text carefully and analyze how sound is produced. Using the jumbled letters in Activity A, write the correct sequence of sound production in human voice box using flow chart.Sound is produced when an object vibrates, creating a pressure wave. This pressure wave causes particles in the surrounding medium (air, water, or solid) to have vibrational motion. As the particles vibrate, they move nearby particles, transmitting the sound further through the medium. The human voice uses several types of sound production and modification mechanisms. The vocal cords located in the larynx (or voice box) in the throat are the primary producers of sound for singing and for spoken vowels. The cords vibrate and produce pressure pulses when air is blown through them.Jumbled Word from Activity A : Energy, Force, Vibration, Sound, Larynx Thx po</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> The desired gene may be microinjected directly into the cell or it may be inserted into the core of a virus by gene splicing and the virus allowed to infect the cell for replication of the gene. The Scientist is clone their gene of interest into a Ti Plasmid, along with DNA sequences that make sure the gene can be expressed in plants. They then reintroduce the vector The gene for human insulin is inserted into the gap in the plasmid. This plasmid is now genetically modified. The genetically modified plasmid is introduced into a new bacteria or yeast cell. This cell then divides rapidly and starts making insulinto Agrobacterium cells and infect plants with the modified Agrobacterium, which delivers the vector to plant cells. Recombinant DNA is a technology scientists developed that made it possible to insert a human gene into the genetic material of a common bacterium. This “recombinant” micro-organism could now produce the protein encoded by the human gene.<br />
