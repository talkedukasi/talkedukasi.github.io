MY OWN AND ONLY LAND
This is the Philippines,
This is my own and only land;
I love her hills and plains,
I love her rivers and oceans,
I love her radiant sunsets and blue skies,
I raise food from her rich soils,
I dive for pearls in her deep oceans
I mine the gold underneath the mountains.
I will make my country clean and safe,
I will work and live for her,
I will fight and die to keep her forever free.
This is my country
God gave it to me.

                                            Directions: Below are summaries/themes of classical poems. Classify the poems as LYRIC, NARRATIVE or DESCRIPTIVE. 1. The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri talks about a man, generally assumed to be Dante himself, is miraculously enabled to undertake an ultramundane journey, which leads him to visit the souls in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.2. The poem “All Things Bright and Beautiful” by Cecil Frances Alexander tells about how great God Almighty is. The God who has given us eyes to see and lips to tell, the God who control the season, the God who controls the sun, and the God who creates and makes everything. 3. The “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” by Thomas Gray is a 1751 poem about the buried inhabitants of a country churchyard and a meditation on the inevitability of death for all.4. This poem by Shakespeare which starts with the line, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day” notes that the young man has qualities that surpass a summer's day.5. The poem Ballad of a Mother’s Heart” by Jose La Villa Tierra talks about a young man who went out late at night to meet his maiden fair. He knelt down in tears and declared his true love towards her. The young girl wants him to prove it by bringing his mother’s heart, he did it without any tears or hesitations. It was raining hard yet he went to his love but on his way, he slipped and felt the pain. He remembered how good his mother is and a voice asked him “were you hurt, child?” It was coming from his mother’s heart.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Most people do not think of their family as having a “culture.”  They associate culture with countries and ethnic groups. But the family? For most of us, it’s just a group of familiar people doing what they always do.</p><p></p><p>Yet it is exactly this—a characteristic way of thinking, feeling, judging, and acting—that defines a culture. In direct and subtle ways, children are molded by the family culture into which they are born. Growing up, their assumptions about what is right and wrong, good and bad, reflect the beliefs, values and traditions of the family culture. Most take for granted their family’s ways, and they carry into adulthood numerous attitudes and behaviors acquired in childhood.</p><p></p><p>2.Is there any love that is nobler Purer and more sublime Than the love of the native country?
