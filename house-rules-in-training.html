" Legislative power is given to a bicameral body, the Philippine Congress, which consists of two chambers - the Senate House (upper chamber) and the House of Representatives flower room). The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country. Senate - The Senate shall consist of twenty -four Senators to be elected to large number of qualified Philippine voters, as may be provided by law.

                                            Sumo is a Japanese kind of wrestling and Japan's national sport. It originated in ancient times as religious performances for the Shinto gods. Nowdays many of its rituals are still followed.
The basic rules of sumo are simple: The wrestler who either touches the floor with something else other than his sole first or leaves the ring before his opponent, loses. The fights themselves usually last only a few seconds and in rare cases up to one minute or more.
Six tournaments are held every year. Each one lasts fifteen days. Three of the tournaments are held in Tokyo, and one each in Fukuoka, Osaka, and Nagoya.
Most elite wrestlers are highly trained athletes who are between twenty-five years old. Besides working out, the wrestlers eat large amounts of food and go to bed right after eating in order to gain mass. The wrestlers live in special sumo houses where the rules are very strict especially for beginners.
Sumo is still popular, and the tournaments are broadcast live on television

MAIN CONCEPTS Legislative power According to Section 1 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines: “The legislative power shall be entrusted to the Philippine Congress to consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives, except to the extent reserved to the people by the provision of the initiative and referendum. " Legislative power is given to a bicameral body, the Philippine Congress, which consists of two chambers - the Senate House (upper chamber) and the House of Representatives flower room). The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country.

                            11. Sumo is a Japanese kind of wrestling and Japan's national sport. It originated in ancient times as religious performances for the Shinto gods. Nowdays many of its rituals are still followed.
The basic rules of sumo are simple: The wrestler who either touches the floor with something else other than his sole first or leaves the ring before his opponent, loses. The fights themselves usually last only a few seconds and in rare cases up to one minute or more.
Six tournaments are held every year. Each one lasts fifteen days. Three of the tournaments are held in Tokyo, and one each in Fukuoka, Osaka, and Nagoya.
Most elite wrestlers are highly trained athletes who are between twenty-five years old. Besides working out, the wrestlers eat large amounts of food and go to bed right after eating in order to gain mass. The wrestlers live in special sumo houses where the rules are very strict especially for beginners.
Sumo is still popular, and the tournaments are broadcast live on television
