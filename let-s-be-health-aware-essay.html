                        Health Awareness should be acknowledged by people at a young age. We should know how to take care of our health. We own our body so we are the only ones who must take care of it. We should understand how our health works from simply understanding how to eat right and exercising but Health Awareness doesn’t focus on just that it also focuses on your mental health. People, aged 12 and above have high chances to experience mental health problems which they are not aware of. They might be depressed without their knowledge because of their lack of education from it. We shouldn’t only focus on keeping our bodies healthy physically but also mentally. You will not function well if you’re body is physically but mentally sick. You’ll lose interest in everything. Health Awareness should be acknowledged by everyone. It doesn’t just help you but also help others to be the best version of themselves.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>     Keeping our thoughts healthy is essential for mental wellness. In general, men are more concerned about maintaining their physical health. The psychological status of people is often disregarded. The greater cognition of humans makes them superior to other animals. Because of his highly evolved intellect, man has been able to regulate life. Therefore, maintaining a man's physical and mental well-being becomes crucial. Better performance and outcomes depend equally on both physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>     A person who is emotionally healthy and stable always feels lively and fully alive and can handle emotionally challenging events with ease. One needs to be physically healthy as well as emotionally strong. Even while mental health is a very individual matter, what affects one person may or may not affect another, and several crucial factors contribute to mental health problems. Our level of fitness is greatly influenced by a variety of emotional elements, such as fear, anger, negative thinking, despair, and violence. Regular exercise helps maintain a high level of physical fitness since physically fit people are generally upbeat and can handle stress and depression with ease.</p><p></p><p>     One of the body's most potent organs, the mind controls how all other organs work. Our bodies' whole physiological processes are impacted when our brains are unbalanced. The secret to success in all facets of life is to be both physically and emotionally healthy.

                        Mental Health Awareness.<p></p><p>Mental illnesses should not be thought of any differently from physical illnesses. In fact, I believe the two are inseparable. Because the whole body is connected and interwoven, the two cannot be separated. The brain is an organ just like everything else in the body and can be hurt like everything else. When the brain is ill, it is not isolated in just the brain, but instead affects the whole body and the overall wellness. Substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide are very common and dangerous in those with mental illnesses. The stigma surrounding mental illness keeps people from getting the help they need to get better and causes them to hide their pain.   </p><p>Receiving help is the most important thing anyone can do for themselves. But unfortunately, the stigma keeps people from getting help.  Mental illness should not be something to be ashamed about or thought of differently. When mental illness is treated equally to other illnesses, more people will have the courage to get help and better their lives.</p><br />

Mental illnesses, also called mental disorders, are a wide range of conditions that affect mood, thinking, and behavior. Many people with mental illnesses are now fighting to increase awareness of disorders like depression and anxiety, and some argue that the best way to educate about mental illnesses is to teach about it in school.

                        <p><strong>Answer:The choice to live a healthier lifestyle is usually made during one's youth, with sports, visits to the gym, and a generally active lifestyle leading to improved health. With obesity on the rise throughout most developed nations like United Kingdom and America, as the combination of junk food and stationary visual media creates a generation of people adverse to physical activity, the need to raise awareness about healthy living has never been greater. For members of my generation, who are in their late thirties or early forties, there are many legitimate reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Unlike most other activities in life, exercising, and eating nutritionally balanced diet present a positive choice with clear advantages and no drawbacks. When you are physically fit as an adult, the benefits also extend to your emotional well being, providing a constructive outlet for negative feelings to be released in a constructive environment. Healthy living can also provide tremendous financial benefits, in the form of savings on groceries or the reduced likelihood of medical expenses, which is especially enticing considering the current economic climate. The following reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle present the argument that eating right and exercising regularly are choices you simply can't afford to neglect.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

In earlier days people like our grandparents have kept good care of their health and fitness through healthy food and by leading a better lifestyle.</p><p>The recent generation was more ignorant of their health and fitness, but the situation has changed a lot recently.

                        <p><strong>Answer:Many people wish to live a good, healthy life and live to be one hundred years old. The only problem is that they don’t want to do the work that comes with living a long life. Hearing the words diet and exercise almost scares them away from the thought of being a healthy individual. Almost thirty five percent of adults are considered to be overweight or obese in the Unites States (CITATION?). Many of them are at risk of many diseases that come with being overweight or obese. Preventing some of those diseases is as simple as changing what and how they eat. Although being obese is normally caused from eating poorly, you can also be at an ideal weight but still not eat the right foods or get the right nutrients in your body. Starting a healthier lifestyle for you comes with living a longer life. In order to have a healthy lifestyle, you need to be educated on what you consume, have an exercise routine, and maintain your new lifestyle. Following these steps will make you a healthier person and help you live a longer happier life. Educating yourself on what foods you consume is the most important part of living a healthier life. As Morgan Griffin from WebMD says, “Eating whole foods is a healthier option than processed foods.” Choosing which foods you should eat more often and foods you should save for a special occasion are very important.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Every year world mental health day is observed on October 10. It was started as an annual activity by the world federation for mental health by deputy secretary-general of UNO at that time. Mental health resources differ significantly from one country to another. While the developed countries in the western world provide mental health programs for all age groups. Also, there are third world countries they struggle to find the basic needs of the families. Thus, it becomes prudent that we are asked to focus on mental health importance for one day. The mental health essay is an insight into the importance of mental health in everyone’s life. </p><p>Mental Health</p><p>In the formidable years, this had no specific theme planned. The main aim was to promote and advocate the public on important issues. Also, in the first three years, one of the central activities done to help the day become special was the 2-hour telecast by the US information agency satellite system. </p><p></p><p>Mental health is not just a concept that refers to an individual’s psychological and emotional well being. Rather it’s a state of psychological and emotional well being where an individual is able to use their cognitive and emotional capabilities, meet the ordinary demand and functions in the society. According to WHO, there is no single ‘official’ definition of mental health.</p><p></p><p>Thus, there are many factors like cultural differences, competing professional theories, and subjective assessments that affect how mental health is defined. Also, there are many experts that agree that mental illness and mental health are not antonyms. So, in other words, when the recognized mental disorder is absent, it is not necessarily a sign of mental health. </p><br />
