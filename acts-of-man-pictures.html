Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes.

The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

If sunlight passes through raindropsat just the right angle, the light is split into an are of colors with red on the outside ofthe band and violet on the inside. This band of colors is made up of red, orange, yellow,green, blue, indigo, and violet light. These are the colors of the rainbow in order. Somepeople remember them by the name ROY G.

From Tagbilaran, you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going to Carmen Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about 4 kilometers before the town of Carmen. From there, have a 10-minute walk along a road winding up to the complex. 4. In 1666, the famous scientist Isaac Newton discovered that if sunlight passes through a triangular piece of glass called a prism, the white light splits into a band of colors. The "birth" of a rainbow after a rainstorm works in a similar way. After it rains, the air in the atmosphere is filled with raindrops. Each raindrop acts like a tiny prism. If sunlight passes through raindrops at just the right angle, the light splits into an arc of colors with red on the outside of the band and violet on the inside. This band of colors is made up of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light. These are the colors of the rainbow in order. Some people remember them by the name ROY G. BIV, 5. Lightning is an electric current. Within a thundercloud way up in the sky, many smail bits of ice (frozen raindrops) bump into each other as they move around in the air. All of those collisions create an electric charge. After a while, the whole cloud fills up with electrical charges. The positive charges or protons form at the top of the cloud and the negative charges or electrons form at the bottom of the cloud. Since opposites attract, that causes a positive charge to build up on the ground beneath the cloud. The grounds electrical charge concentrates around anything that sticks up, such as mountains, people, or single trees. The charge coming up from these points eventually connects with a charge reaching down from the clouds and zap-lightning strikes!Please Answer This CorrectlyCorrect✅-Brain liest✨Wrong, Nonsense❌-Report ​</a>

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

A- long, long time ago, Arojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinaryinortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tets venturned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as a lasting proof of has atlet,now known as, the Chocolate Hills.2. Looking like giant molehills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol's most famous touristattraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that thesehills are natural artifacts or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building themsurely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt.The hills are no less than 1268 in number. Uniform in shape, they are between 30 and50 meters high, They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns intochocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived.3. If you wish to get to the Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. From Tagbilaran, youwill have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going to Carmen. Ask thedriver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about 4 kilometers before thetown of Carmen. From there, have a 10-minute walk along a road winding up to the complex.4.

In 1666, the famous scientist Isaac Newton discovered that if sunlight passes through a triangular piece of glass called a prism, the white light splits into a band of colors. The "birth" of a rainbow after a rainstorm works in a similar way. After it rains, the air in the atmosphere is filled with raindrops. Each raindrop acts like a tiny prism. If sunlight passes through raindrops at just the right angle, the light splits into an arc of colors with red on the outside of the band and violet on the inside. This band of colors is made up of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light. These are the colors of the rainbow in order. Some people remember them by the name ROY G. BIV, 5. Lightning is an electric current. Within a thundercloud way up in the sky, many smail bits of ice (frozen raindrops) bump into each other as they move around in the air. All of those collisions create an electric charge. After a while, the whole cloud fills up with electrical charges. The positive charges or protons form at the top of the cloud and the negative charges or electrons form at the bottom of the cloud. Since opposites attract, that causes a positive charge to build up on the ground beneath the cloud. The grounds electrical charge concentrates around anything that sticks up, such as mountains, people, or single trees. The charge coming up from these points eventually connects with a charge reaching down from the clouds and zap-lightning strikes!Please Answer This CorrectlyCorrect✅-Brain liest✨Wrong, Nonsense❌-Report ​</h2><br />
