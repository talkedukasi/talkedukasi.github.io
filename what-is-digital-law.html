Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man

5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Digital law can be defined as the legal rights and restrictions governing technology use. In today's world, many people are not responsible digital citizens. They are criminals, breaking the law, either knowing or not knowing, what is appropriate or inappropriate technology use. For example, many people think that it is okay to download music without paying for it. This is illegal though and there can be serious consequences if caught. You can pay a hefty fine or even go to jail. Other violations include illegal file sharing sites, pirating software, creating viruses, hacking into systems or networks, stealing someones identity, and copyright infringement. In order to create a functioning 21st century global society with responsible digital citizens, students need to be taught and informed of these violations.</p><br />

Which example has particles that can be drawn closer to occupy smaller volume?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>C. air inside the syringe</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>The air inside the syringe although not seen can be felt. Try blocking the syringe air passage and you will be able to feel that you can not push the syringe further. This is because the air particles are already being compressed together.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>2. Which of the following phenomena does NOT involve the application of gas pressure? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>b. falling leaves</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p><p>When a leaf fall there is only minimal air resistance that is acting upon the leaf. That's why Falling leaf is an example of a freely falling object that the only force affects it is gravity.</p><p></p><p>
3. ...What is the probable explanation for the blown out tire during a long summer drive? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p>D. The volume of gases increases as the temperature increases, causing a blown up tire.
</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>This can be explained with Charle's Law that as Temperature increases, Volume increases. The continues friction that is acted upon the tire of the car caused the rise in temperature to the tire. Also take note that the scenario illustrated is during the summer.</p><p></p><p>4. How can you possibly prove that gases have negligible mass? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p>A. put a balloon in a digital balance before and after you fill it with air</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>This is the most possible way to weigh air by containing it inside the balloon. </p><p></p><p>5. What happens to the density of a gas as its volume decreases at constant pressure and temperature? </p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p>b. increases</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p>Lets take into consideration the formula of density which is ρ = mass/volume. by taking mass away from the latter an replacing it with constant k we can infer that the relationship between density and volume is inversely proportional.</p><p>_________________________</p><p>For numbers 6 to 8 choices:</p><p><strong>a.

Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</h2><br />
