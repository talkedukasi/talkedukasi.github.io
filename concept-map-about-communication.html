                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180° and 100°E in the Northern Hemisphere. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin,[1] and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E). The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.[2]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paki brainliest Po please</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I. Introduction</p><p></p><p>Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters that can strike without warning. It is crucial to have a plan in place to ensure the safety of everyone in the community before, during, and after an earthquake. This action plan aims to provide specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound measures for individuals and organizations in the community to prepare for an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>II. The Community Action Plan</p><p></p><p>A. Problem</p><p></p><p>Three environmental problems that are evident within the community are:</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings - Many buildings in the community are not built to withstand earthquakes, which can lead to collapse and severe damage.</p><p></p><p>Inadequate emergency response system - The community lacks a well-coordinated emergency response system to respond promptly and efficiently during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness - The majority of the community lacks awareness and preparedness when it comes to earthquakes, which can lead to panic and confusion during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>B. Suggested Policy/Program/Project</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings:</p><p>a. Retrofitting program - The local government can establish a retrofitting program that will require building owners to retrofit their structures to make them earthquake-resistant. This program can be enforced through inspections, incentives, and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>b. Public education campaign - A public education campaign can be launched to inform the community about the importance of earthquake-resistant buildings and how to retrofit existing structures. The campaign can use various media such as billboards, flyers, and social media to reach a wide audience.</p><p></p><p>Inadequate emergency response system:</p><p>a. Emergency drills - The local government can organize and conduct regular emergency drills for the community, including schools, hospitals, and other public institutions. These drills can help improve coordination and response times during an earthquake.</p><p>b. Establish an emergency response center - The local government can establish an emergency response center that will serve as a central point for coordinating emergency response activities. The center can be staffed by trained personnel and equipped with necessary resources, including communication equipment, medical supplies, and search and rescue tools.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness:</p><p>a. Community awareness program - The local government can organize and conduct a community awareness program that will educate the community about earthquakes, their impacts, and how to prepare for them. This program can include seminars, workshops, and community meetings.</p><p>b. Emergency preparedness kits - The local government can provide emergency preparedness kits to households in the community. These kits can include essential supplies such as food, water, first aid supplies, and communication equipment.</p><p></p><p>C. Pictures/Graphics</p><p></p><p>Include pictures that represent the proposed projects and programs.</p><p></p><p>III. Summary</p><p></p><p>This community action plan aims to address three environmental problems that are evident in the community concerning earthquakes. It proposes specific policies, programs, and projects that are measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound to improve earthquake resilience in the community. The plan includes a retrofitting program, public education campaign, emergency drills, emergency response center, community awareness program, and emergency preparedness kits. By implementing these measures, the community can improve its preparedness and response to earthquakes, reducing the risk of casualties and damages.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Create meanings</p><p><strong>Communication </strong>is irreversible because we cannot take back once we said and utter words to someone that may destroy our relationship with them. We can't also reverse messages in <strong>written communication</strong> even we delete and change some words in the texts once it has been passed to the others.</p><p>It is also symbolic. We use symbols as representations that send a message to the people, such as sign language, body language, facial expressions and gestures and postures.</p><p>Also, <strong>communication </strong>does not always guarantee to solve relationship problems especially if we forced ourselves to apologize after a fight. Sometimes avoiding communication to someone can resolve many issues.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong> is proactive because we evaluate the messages we receive from the people around us and validates it. </p><p>Last, we can create meanings once we get involved in <strong>communication </strong>and learn from others' experiences. We can also give our own meanings in a particular experience or phenomenon based on our background and attitudes. For example, for a farmer, rain is a blessing to have a bountiful harvest, while for a commuter who forgot his/her umbrella rain can cause unfortunate events such as being late for work due to traffic.</p><p>There are other meanings and explanations about communication such as the follows:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6516173</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5564408</p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
