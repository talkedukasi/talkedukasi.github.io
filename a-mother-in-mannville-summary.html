Then, he carried his mother on his back and started walking towards the summit of Obatsayuma, the mountain of the

“abandoning of aged”. On their way to the summit, the helpless mother noticed the

dangerous path and thought that her son doesn't know the paths and might passthrough danger so she reached for twigs, snapped them to pieces and quietly dropped them until they reached the summit.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><strong>Mother Knows Best (Summary)</strong><p></p><p>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the woods, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was adventurous and curious, always eager to explore the world beyond her village. However, her mother, Mrs. Jenkins, was a cautious and overprotective woman who constantly warned Lily about the dangers that lurked outside their cozy home.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Jenkins had experienced her fair share of hardships in her youth, and she wanted to protect her daughter from making the same mistakes. She often advised Lily to stay within the safety of the village and follow the rules and traditions that had been passed down for generations.</p><p></p><p>But Lily grew restless. She yearned to see what lay beyond the familiar village, to discover new lands and meet new people. One day, despite her mother's warnings, Lily decided to venture into the woods alone.</p><p></p><p>She packed her bag, said goodbye to her mother, and set off on her journey. Along the way, she encountered various challenges, including wild animals, treacherous paths, and harsh weather. However, Lily's determination and resourcefulness helped her overcome each obstacle.</p><p></p><p>As she continued her journey, Lily made new friends from different walks of life, learned about different cultures, and gained valuable life experiences. She discovered her own strengths and talents, and her confidence grew with each step she took.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Jenkins was filled with worry and regret for allowing her daughter to leave. She searched high and low, asking villagers for help, but Lily was nowhere to be found. Mrs. Jenkins realized that her fears and anxieties had clouded her judgment, and she had failed to trust her daughter's abilities.</p><p></p><p>After months of traveling, Lily returned to the village, brimming with stories of her adventures. She was greeted with a mix of relief and joy from her mother, who had learned the importance of letting go and allowing her daughter to follow her own path.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Mrs. Jenkins realized that while it was natural for a mother to worry, she had to trust her daughter and allow her to make her own choices and learn from her own mistakes. Lily, on the other hand, appreciated her mother's love and concern, but was grateful for the opportunities she had outside the village, which had shaped her into a confident and independent individual.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Lily and her mother shared a deep bond built on mutual respect, understanding, and trust. They lived happily in the village, and Lily continued to explore the world with her mother's blessings and guidance, knowing that her mother's love would always be there, watching over her and supporting her in her adventures. And they all lived happily ever after.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       Also known as The Story of the Aged Mother, this Japanese folktale tells the story of an unkind ruler who issues cruel orders, including one demand that all old folks are to be abandoned and left to die. Basho tells a poignant story about a mother and her son and their love for one another. The governor did not penalize him for rescuing his mother, but he did withdraw his proclamation as he recognized the value of the elderly in a country's development. The narrative ends with the moral that the knowledge of the elderly is just as vital as the strength of the youth.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

The son followed his mother's advice and used a twisted straw to create the rope, which he then burned on a row of flat stones on a windless night.</p><p>Knowing that he had help, he told the monarch that his mother's age and wisdom had enabled him to accomplish such an impossible task.</p><p><strong>Last</strong> but not least, the emperor initially imprisoned the guy but then changed his mind and quoted the proverb "With the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom! ”.
