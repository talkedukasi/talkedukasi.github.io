"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
