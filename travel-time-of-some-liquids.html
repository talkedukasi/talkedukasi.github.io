They supply lumber which is used for building houses, stones, offices, and other buildings. Some forest trees give materials for making pulp. paper, wallboard and furniture, rattan, gum, and firewood. Medicinal plants are also taken from forests. 2. Digestive process begins when food enters the mouth. After the mouth chews and swallows the food, it goes to the throat and then travels to the esophagus or swallowing tube. Next the esophagus, through a series of contractions called peristalsis delivers the food to the stomach which acts as the storage tank. The stomach contains hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes which when mix with the food, the food begins to break down into smaller molecules. Then the food enters the small intestine where in 90% of the food nutrients have been extracted here and absorbed by the body. The remaining goes to the iarge intestine as waste product. Finally, this waste product is excreted from the body as a solid matter called stool. 3 The amount of water on Earth remains constant. But its form is always changing, from solid to liquid, from liquid to gas, and back again. It moves in a pattern called the water cycle. Heat from the sun causes water in oceans, lakes, and rivers to evaporate into vapor. Further vapor is given off by plants and animals.pasagot need ko na now​</a>

Use the words in the box to fill in the blanks.
rectum ,wastetongue ,acid ,absorbed ,mouth
large intestine , energy, esophagus ,small intestine
All animals need to eat food to get ______1______ to live. But in order to use this food, they have to break it down in a process called digestion. And so, all animals have a group of connected organs called the digestive system. 
In humans, the process of digestion begins in the ______2_______ where food is chewed into small pieces by the teeth. The __3___helps by moving these pieces around. These pieces are covered by saliva, or spit. The saliva makes the food slippery so that it is easier to swallow. It also helps to break down the food.
Once the food is swallowed, it passes through the pharynx, which is like a gate that sends food into the ______4________ and air into the lungs. The food travels down the esophagusand into the stomach. Once in the stomach the food is mixed with ______5_______ and crushed some more.
After spending some time in the stomach, the food is sent into the _____6________where nutrients are _______7_______. The liver helps by producing some digestive juices called bile. Next, the remaining food goes into the _____________8____________ where the liquids are absorbed. The remaining food is called ________9_________ and it is pushed into the ______10__________ where it waits before leaving the body.

Sound is produced when a vibration causes pressure variations in the medium.2. Sound waves require a medium to travel, some kind of physical material.3. Compared to liquids, sound travel faster through gases.4. Sound waves are the compression and rarefaction of physical material.5. Sound waves travel through space.6. The compression and rarefaction allows sound waves to travel through liquids and gases but notthrough solids.7. Space is a vacuum, and a vacuum is defined by the very absence of physical material.8. A sound wave is a transverse wave.9. The size of compression indicates how much energy the sound wave has.10. Sound wave with large compression has a high energy.11. In a low-density material, like air, sound travels faster because the atoms are farther apart.12. The speed at which sound travels through a material depends on the density of the material.13. It is possible for astronauts on the moon to talk to each other without the aid of modern electroniccommunication system because of the atmosphere in the surroundings,14.

                                            Earthquakes and Volcanoes
The Earth's crust is constantly moving throughout the world. It moves in some places more often than in other places. The Earth's crust moves when blocks of the earth abruptly slip past one another. This results in an Earthquake. Earthquakes are related to cracks in the crust called faults. 
Faults may have formed from an earlier earthquake or while an earthquake is occurring. During an earthquake the crust is in motion on either side or both sides of the fault. 
The earthquake vibrations travel through the crust and the farther people are away from the earthquake the harder it is to feel the vibrations. The location below where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the area directly above it on the surface of the earth it is called the epicenter. 
A seismograph is a device that records the motion at locations all around the crust. The size of an earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake that takes place. The lower the magnitude of an earthquake the less damage is done to a town or city. Large earthquakes can destroy entire towns and cities. Earthquakes in the United States are more likely to occur along the West Coast, but they can also occur in the Midwest and along the East Coast. 
An underwater earthquake can cause a tsunami. A tsunami is a large ocean wave which can reach the coastlines and cause major damage and flooding. Earthquakes may also be the cause of some volcanoes to become active and erupt. 
A volcano is a rupture on the crust of the Earth that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. The hot molten rock deep below Earth's surface is called magma and it rises upward. If the magma reaches the surface of the Earth it may flow out as lava, or it is hurled out when the volcano erupts. Magma is liquid rock inside the volcano; lava is liquid rock on the outside of the volcano. 
Scientists have classified volcanoes into three main categories: active, dormant, and extinct. With an active volcano there is the possibility the volcano will erupt, and most likely recently erupted. A dormant volcano is a volcano is one that has not erupted in a very long time but there is possibility that it may erupt sometime in the future. The third type, the extinct volcano, is one that erupted thousands of years ago and there is no possibility of another eruption. 
The Earth is home to approximately 1500 volcanoes which are considered active, and about 100 of those are under the oceans. Many active volcanoes in the United States are found in Hawaii, California, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. Erupting volcanos have been known to wipe out entire forests, trigger tsunamis, flash floods, earthquakes, mudflows, avalanches, mudslides, and rock falls. However, volcanos that erupt can also create new islands once the hot lava cools off, especially those near the coast or below the ocean's surface. 
In summary, an earthquake caused by a fault in the earth's crust, and a volcano, caused by a rupture on the crust of the Earth, are related to each other and both can cause major damage and destruction. An earthquake can also cause a tsunami, which is a giant ocean wave. There are three types of volcanos: active, dormant, and extinct. Earthquakes and volcanos are both considered natural disasters.

is a parameter wherein it determines the energy and time acquired to make a
liquid flow. Just like the case of friction that occurs between two moving solid
objects, Viscosity is the friction or an interaction between molecules between
liquid and it is defined as the resistance of liquid to flow. <br /></p><br />

                        <p>The travel time of some liquids may differ from its flow. So
for example, slime that has a very thick substance it means it is very slow to
flow and water that has a thin substance that is very quick to flow. To
identify the resistance of liquid, we use the term Viscosity. <br /></p><br />

They supply lumber which is used for building houses, stones, offices, and other buildings. Some forest trees give materials for making pulp. paper, wallboard and furniture, rattan, gum, and firewood. Medicinal plants are also taken from forests. 2. Digestive process begins when food enters the mouth. After the mouth chews and swallows the food, it goes to the throat and then travels to the esophagus or swallowing tube. Next the esophagus, through a series of contractions called peristalsis delivers the food to the stomach which acts as the storage tank. The stomach contains hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes which when mix with the food, the food begins to break down into smaller molecules. Then the food enters the small intestine where in 90% of the food nutrients have been extracted here and absorbed by the body. The remaining goes to the iarge intestine as waste product. Finally, this waste product is excreted from the body as a solid matter called stool. 3 The amount of water on Earth remains constant. But its form is always changing, from solid to liquid, from liquid to gas, and back again. It moves in a pattern called the water cycle. Heat from the sun causes water in oceans, lakes, and rivers to evaporate into vapor. Further vapor is given off by plants and animals.pasagot need ko na now​</h2><br />

It begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. It then travels down the esophagus into the stomach, where the food is mixed with acid and broken down further. Then it travels to the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. The liver produces digestive juices called bile, which help break down the food further. The remaining food is pushed into the large intestine, where liquids are absorbed and waste is created. Finally, the waste travels to the rectum, where it is eliminated from the body.</p><br />

                            22. Earthquakes and Volcanoes
The Earth's crust is constantly moving throughout the world. It moves in some places more often than in other places. The Earth's crust moves when blocks of the earth abruptly slip past one another. This results in an Earthquake. Earthquakes are related to cracks in the crust called faults. 
Faults may have formed from an earlier earthquake or while an earthquake is occurring. During an earthquake the crust is in motion on either side or both sides of the fault. 
The earthquake vibrations travel through the crust and the farther people are away from the earthquake the harder it is to feel the vibrations. The location below where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the area directly above it on the surface of the earth it is called the epicenter. 
A seismograph is a device that records the motion at locations all around the crust. The size of an earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake that takes place. The lower the magnitude of an earthquake the less damage is done to a town or city. Large earthquakes can destroy entire towns and cities. Earthquakes in the United States are more likely to occur along the West Coast, but they can also occur in the Midwest and along the East Coast. 
An underwater earthquake can cause a tsunami. A tsunami is a large ocean wave which can reach the coastlines and cause major damage and flooding. Earthquakes may also be the cause of some volcanoes to become active and erupt. 
A volcano is a rupture on the crust of the Earth that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. The hot molten rock deep below Earth's surface is called magma and it rises upward. If the magma reaches the surface of the Earth it may flow out as lava, or it is hurled out when the volcano erupts. Magma is liquid rock inside the volcano; lava is liquid rock on the outside of the volcano. 
Scientists have classified volcanoes into three main categories: active, dormant, and extinct. With an active volcano there is the possibility the volcano will erupt, and most likely recently erupted. A dormant volcano is a volcano is one that has not erupted in a very long time but there is possibility that it may erupt sometime in the future. The third type, the extinct volcano, is one that erupted thousands of years ago and there is no possibility of another eruption. 
The Earth is home to approximately 1500 volcanoes which are considered active, and about 100 of those are under the oceans. Many active volcanoes in the United States are found in Hawaii, California, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. Erupting volcanos have been known to wipe out entire forests, trigger tsunamis, flash floods, earthquakes, mudflows, avalanches, mudslides, and rock falls. However, volcanos that erupt can also create new islands once the hot lava cools off, especially those near the coast or below the ocean's surface. 
In summary, an earthquake caused by a fault in the earth's crust, and a volcano, caused by a rupture on the crust of the Earth, are related to each other and both can cause major damage and destruction. An earthquake can also cause a tsunami, which is a giant ocean wave. There are three types of volcanos: active, dormant, and extinct. Earthquakes and volcanos are both considered natural disasters.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All animals need to eat 1.  Food  to get 2.  Energy  to live. But in order to use this food, they have a break it down in a process called 3.  digestion  And so, all animals have a group of connected organs called the Digestive 4.  System . In humans the process of digestion begins in the 5.  mouth  where food is 6.  chewed  into small pieces by the teeth. The 7.  tounge  helps by moving these pieces around. These pieces are covered by 8.  saliva  or spit. The saliva makes the food slippery so that is easier to 9.  swallow . It also helps to break down the food. Once the food is swallowed, it passes through the 10.  pharynx , which is like a gate that sends food into the 11.  esophagus  and air into the lungs. The food travels down the esophagus and into the 12.  stomach . Once the food is mixed with 13.  acid  and crushed some more. After spending some time in the stomach, the food is sent into the 14.  small intestine  where nutrients are 15.  absorbed . The 16.  liver  helps by producing some digestive juices called bile. Next, the remaining food goes into the 17.  large intestine  where the 18.  liquids  are absorbed. The remaining food is called 19.  waste  and it is pushed into the 20.  rectum  where it wait's before leaving the body.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Food</p><p>2. Energy</p><p>3. digestion</p><p>4.
