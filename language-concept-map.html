Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</a>

                                            What's In In your previous lesson, you learned that emotive language refers to word choices that are actually designed to stir up emotional responses. Its main purpose is to convince the reader or listener to share the writer or speaker's point of view using language that stimulates an emotional reaction. We often encounter these words in public speaking, creative writing, fictional and non-fictional writing and even on daily conversations. Most of these words are adjectives, verbs and adverbs. For example, the words irritated, amused and strongly denote strong impact if used in sentences. With this learning, you are now ready to discover new concepts and skills that would enable you to explain, interpret and relate visual and verbal relationships illustrated in tables, graphs and information maps found in expository texts.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When we think about communication, we most often focus on how we exchange information using words. While verbal communication is important, humans relied on nonverbal communication for thousands of years before we developed the capability to communicate with words. Nonverbal communication is a process of generating meaning using behavior other than words. Rather than thinking of nonverbal communication as the opposite of or as separate from verbal communication, it’s more accurate to view them as operating side by side—as part of the same system. Yet, as part of the same system, they still have important differences, including how the brain processes them. For instance, nonverbal communication is typically governed by the right side of the brain and verbal, the left.Peter A. Andersen, Nonverbal Communication: Forms and Functions (Mountain View, CA: Mayfield, 1999), 2–8. This hemispheric distinction has been clearly evidenced, as people who suffer trauma to the right side of their brain lose the ability to recognize facial expressions but can still process verbal communication. Conversely, people whose left hemisphere of the brain is damaged lose the ability to speak, read, and understand language. Interestingly, a person with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain who loses the ability to speak can often still sing since the creation, but not the reading, of music is governed by the right brain. The content and composition of verbal and nonverbal communication also differs. In terms of content, nonverbal communication tends to do the work of communicating emotions more than verbal. In terms of composition, although there are rules of grammar that structure our verbal communication, no such official guides govern our use of nonverbal signals. Likewise, there aren’t dictionaries and thesauruses of nonverbal communication like there are with verbal symbols. Finally, whereas we humans are unique in our capacity to abstract and transcend space and time using verbal symbols, we are not the only creatures that engage in nonverbal communication.Owen Hargie, Skilled Interpersonal Interaction: Research, Theory, and Practice, 5th ed. (London: Routledge, 2011), 49. These are just some of the characteristics that differentiate verbal communication from nonverbal, and in the remainder of this chapter we will discuss in more detail the principles, functions, and types of nonverbal communication and conclude with some guidance on how to improve our nonverbal communication competence.

                            24. 
Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</h2><br />

                            25. What's In In your previous lesson, you learned that emotive language refers to word choices that are actually designed to stir up emotional responses. Its main purpose is to convince the reader or listener to share the writer or speaker's point of view using language that stimulates an emotional reaction. We often encounter these words in public speaking, creative writing, fictional and non-fictional writing and even on daily conversations. Most of these words are adjectives, verbs and adverbs. For example, the words irritated, amused and strongly denote strong impact if used in sentences. With this learning, you are now ready to discover new concepts and skills that would enable you to explain, interpret and relate visual and verbal relationships illustrated in tables, graphs and information maps found in expository texts.​</h2><br />
