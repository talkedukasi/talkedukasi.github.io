After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

                                            PLS CAN YOU ALL ANSWER THIS?Direction: Arrange the following to form a complete critique of the selection “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant I. The short story's theme involves the pitfalls of pride. Mathilde's pride in her beauty prompts her to buy an expensive dress and borrow seemingly expensive jewelry, which triggers her downfall. She fed her pride for one night but paid for it over the next 10 years of hardship, which destroyed her beauty. Pride also prevented her friend from acknowledging initially that the necklace was a fake, which would have prevented Mathilde's downfall.II. At the end of the story, the question that arises is, „who is to blame for the misery that this couple finds itself in?‟ the blame seems to be solely on Mathilde because of her irrationality in thought and action. If only she is keener about what she desires and takes time before acting on her wishes, maybe her life and that of the husband would have turned out to be better. She ruins her entire life and that of her husband because of just a single night of pleasure.III. "The Necklace" is a short story by 19th-century French author Guy de Maupassant, who is regarded as one of the early masters of the short story. It's often studied in English and world literature classes. Maupassant is known for writing about the travails of average people in French society and their efforts to get ahead, often with unhappy results.IV. Similarly, the jewelry represents the illusion of wealth in which Madame Forestier and the aristocratic class indulge. While Madame Forestier knew the jewels were fake, she did not tell Mathilde because she enjoyed the illusion of appearing wealthy and generous in lending a seemingly expensive item. People often admire the wealthy, aristocratic class, but sometimes their wealth is an illusion.V. By using Mathilde as the protagonist in the story, Maupassant is able to create an ironic ending that the readers do not expect. Several moral lessons can also be learnt when one reads of the calamity that befalls Mathilde and the husband. The character of Mathilde has changed drastically at the end of the story compared with the first time the reader encounters her in the beginning of the story. She no longer complains about life and wanting more wealth as she did in the beginning.QUESTIONS: Choose the correct arrangement of the selection “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant among the given choicesA.

Write them in the radial cycle below.A radial cycle shows how the variables in the outer ring contribute to the central concept. This activity will show how Ana and Boy's characteristics and competencies contributed to their success as entrepreneurs. Do you see a bit of yourself in Ana and Boy? Do you see yourself as an entrepreneur?(THE STORY)(1)Ana and Boy's first venture into entrepreneurship was through a bakery business. The couple lived in Las Piñas, near a subdivision and a commercial area with no presence of a bakery in the vicinity. Ana and Boy, however, also had no knowledge and experience in baking. What they lacked in know-how and skill, though, they made up for willingness to learn. The couple both went back to school and enrolled in courses on commercial baking and attended food demonstrations to further their knowledge on the bakery business. With a fifty thousand capital borrowed from a friend, Moonbake was born. They sold pan de sal, pan de coco, and Spanish bread to neighbors and sari-sari stores in the area. Business was good and continued to get better, until they hit a roadblock Raw material costs started rising, supply of sugar grew scarce, and(2)competition started sprouting all over the area. The couple, unwilling to be hindered by the roadblock, went back to school again. Boy took up a course in the "Rehabilitation of Distressed Industries" and, applying what he learned, StarGlow was born. It was formed to be the marketing arm of Moonbake, and soon sales started to pick up again.(3)Not stopping yet, the couple decided to diversify. They aimed to export and they looked for a good product to introduce to the global market. They visited the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and became interested in the vacuum fried tahong (mussel). Using the vacuum frier in ITDI, they initiated a pilot run. Unfortunately, the vacuum fried tahong proved to be a short venture for the couple and after incurring PhP 100,000 loss, they decided to look for a new product.(5)They visited yet another DOST agency, the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FRNI). They became interested in the canned laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut cream with shrimp paste, ginger, and silinglabuyo). This time, their pilot run at FNRI became successful. They know they have a good product on hand and after they launched it at the First Asian Ethnic Food Festival, they were able to secure a deal with ShoeMart and after a couple of years, sent their first delivery to Guam and eventually, to the Middle East, Canada, the USA, and Europe. From the canned laing, another company, Moondish, was born.(6)From a simple idea, Ana and Boy now has three companies: Moonbake, Moondish (under Moonbake), and StarGlow. The two manufacturing companies operate following the tenets of total quality management. Moondish, in addition, underwent Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points, a requirement for all food exporters. Quality starts from the source, and thus the couple sought out and got in touch with farmers from Laguna and Bicol and chose the best variety of gabi leaves- the white one- as those leave a less itchy sensation in the mouth. To retain their farmer-suppliers and enjoy a stable supply of quality raw materials, the couple treats them well and pays them as they deserve. Ana and Boy, through all the hardships they underwent in the name of entrepreneurship, likewise got what they so deserved: success.</a>

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil.

                            5. PLS CAN YOU ALL ANSWER THIS?Direction: Arrange the following to form a complete critique of the selection “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant I. The short story's theme involves the pitfalls of pride. Mathilde's pride in her beauty prompts her to buy an expensive dress and borrow seemingly expensive jewelry, which triggers her downfall. She fed her pride for one night but paid for it over the next 10 years of hardship, which destroyed her beauty. Pride also prevented her friend from acknowledging initially that the necklace was a fake, which would have prevented Mathilde's downfall.II. At the end of the story, the question that arises is, „who is to blame for the misery that this couple finds itself in?‟ the blame seems to be solely on Mathilde because of her irrationality in thought and action. If only she is keener about what she desires and takes time before acting on her wishes, maybe her life and that of the husband would have turned out to be better. She ruins her entire life and that of her husband because of just a single night of pleasure.III. "The Necklace" is a short story by 19th-century French author Guy de Maupassant, who is regarded as one of the early masters of the short story. It's often studied in English and world literature classes. Maupassant is known for writing about the travails of average people in French society and their efforts to get ahead, often with unhappy results.IV. Similarly, the jewelry represents the illusion of wealth in which Madame Forestier and the aristocratic class indulge. While Madame Forestier knew the jewels were fake, she did not tell Mathilde because she enjoyed the illusion of appearing wealthy and generous in lending a seemingly expensive item. People often admire the wealthy, aristocratic class, but sometimes their wealth is an illusion.V. By using Mathilde as the protagonist in the story, Maupassant is able to create an ironic ending that the readers do not expect. Several moral lessons can also be learnt when one reads of the calamity that befalls Mathilde and the husband. The character of Mathilde has changed drastically at the end of the story compared with the first time the reader encounters her in the beginning of the story. She no longer complains about life and wanting more wealth as she did in the beginning.QUESTIONS: Choose the correct arrangement of the selection “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant among the given choicesA.

The couple lived in Las Piñas, near a subdivision and a commercial area with no presence of a bakery in the vicinity. Ana and Boy, however, also had no knowledge and experience in baking. What they lacked in know-how and skill, though, they made up for willingness to learn. The couple both went back to school and enrolled in courses on commercial baking and attended food demonstrations to further their knowledge on the bakery business. With a fifty thousand capital borrowed from a friend, Moonbake was born. They sold pan de sal, pan de coco, and Spanish bread to neighbors and sari-sari stores in the area. Business was good and continued to get better, until they hit a roadblock Raw material costs started rising, supply of sugar grew scarce, and(2)competition started sprouting all over the area. The couple, unwilling to be hindered by the roadblock, went back to school again. Boy took up a course in the "Rehabilitation of Distressed Industries" and, applying what he learned, StarGlow was born. It was formed to be the marketing arm of Moonbake, and soon sales started to pick up again.(3)Not stopping yet, the couple decided to diversify. They aimed to export and they looked for a good product to introduce to the global market. They visited the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and became interested in the vacuum fried tahong (mussel). Using the vacuum frier in ITDI, they initiated a pilot run. Unfortunately, the vacuum fried tahong proved to be a short venture for the couple and after incurring PhP 100,000 loss, they decided to look for a new product.(5)They visited yet another DOST agency, the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FRNI). They became interested in the canned laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut cream with shrimp paste, ginger, and silinglabuyo). This time, their pilot run at FNRI became successful. They know they have a good product on hand and after they launched it at the First Asian Ethnic Food Festival, they were able to secure a deal with ShoeMart and after a couple of years, sent their first delivery to Guam and eventually, to the Middle East, Canada, the USA, and Europe. From the canned laing, another company, Moondish, was born.(6)From a simple idea, Ana and Boy now has three companies: Moonbake, Moondish (under Moonbake), and StarGlow. The two manufacturing companies operate following the tenets of total quality management. Moondish, in addition, underwent Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points, a requirement for all food exporters. Quality starts from the source, and thus the couple sought out and got in touch with farmers from Laguna and Bicol and chose the best variety of gabi leaves- the white one- as those leave a less itchy sensation in the mouth. To retain their farmer-suppliers and enjoy a stable supply of quality raw materials, the couple treats them well and pays them as they deserve. Ana and Boy, through all the hardships they underwent in the name of entrepreneurship, likewise got what they so deserved: success.</h2><br />

                            15. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.
