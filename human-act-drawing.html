Helping Kids Work Through Stress Paola Navarette 
Children may be processing the disruptions in their lives right now in ways the adults around them do not expect: acting out, regressing, retreating, or even seeming surprisingly content. Parents need to know that all of this is normal, experts say, and there are some things we can do to help. 
“Children need adults’ love and attention during difficult times,” says World Health Organization (WHO) in a statement. “Respond to your child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns, and give them extra love and attention.” WHO suggests keeping children close to their parents and family and avoid separating children and their caregivers as much as possible. “Make opportunities for the child to play and relax and keep to regular routines,” it said. “Provide facts about what has happened, explain what is going on right now, and give them clear information about how they can reduce their risk of being infected in words that they can understand.” 
But in some cases, exposure to stressful events—which right now might include a parent’s job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness of someone a child cares about—can leave children feeling traumatized. Parents, therefore, need to learn other strategies to help their children navigate away from feelings of anxiety.

Helping Kids Work Through Stress Paola Navarette 
Children may be processing the disruptions in their lives right now in ways the adults around them do not expect: acting out, regressing, retreating, or even seeming surprisingly content. Parents need to know that all of this is normal, experts say, and there are some things we can do to help. 
“Children need adults’ love and attention during difficult times,” says World Health Organization (WHO) in a statement. “Respond to your child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns, and give them extra love and attention.” WHO suggests keeping children close to their parents and family and avoid separating children and their caregivers as much as possible. “Make opportunities for the child to play and relax and keep to regular routines,” it said. “Provide facts about what has happened, explain what is going on right now, and give them clear information about how they can reduce their risk of being infected in words that they can understand.” 
But in some cases, exposure to stressful events—which right now might include a parent’s job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness of someone a child cares about—can leave children feeling traumatized. Parents, therefore, need to learn other strategies to help their children navigate away from feelings of anxiety.
