                                            The learners are asked to read the following excerpt from selection, “Pliant Like
A Bamboo "by Ismael Mallari. Then answer the questions that follow.
1. There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the
wind to make the decision.
2. The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself.
But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
3. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations,
but let the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the
bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.

He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so, he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.SENTENCE 1. *SENTENCE 2. *SENTENCE 3. *SENTENCE 4. *SENTENCE 5. *NEED KO PO NG HELP DITO</a>

My leaves are green and can provide shades; not mentioning the sweet fruits that I can give." The bamboo was listening but it remained silent. Day after day, the mango tree became proud of itself. 3 It usually talked about how strongly it became and how useful it was to the people. One day, a strong typhoon came. The mango tree stood proudly against the wind. It never bent nor yielded. But its roots were uprooted and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree might not be as robust as the mango tree; however, it found its way against the wind. Every time the strong winds blew, it bent. It swayed. Its branches swayed. At the end, the bamboo tree stood still. (Adapted from the essay, Pliant Like a Bamboo by I.V. Mallari) Process Questions 1. How will you describe the mango tree? 2.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</a>

                        <p>The statement that said<strong> “The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield”</strong> means that the tree is strong. The scenario seems to describe the tree’s reaction to a natural force such as a typhoon.<strong> It seems to show that the strong wind was unable to pull its roots from the ground, hence it stood fast.</strong> When we speak of a tree that <strong>won’t yield</strong>, it means it will not relinquish its position, giving the impression of fighting back. <strong>So the statement is saying that the tree was strong enough to withstand the typhoon.  </strong></p><p><strong>

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</h2><br />
