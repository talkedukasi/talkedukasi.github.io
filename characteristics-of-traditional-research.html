                            27. "This article explores how poor, young men in a Manila relocation site enter into a brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood, which emanates out of a Greek - letter fraternity tradition in US and Philippines universities, the young men establish a link with people and networks in power. Drawing on ritual and religious sacrifice theory, the article illustrate how sacrificial violence in initiation rites becomes a performance of worth. This performance of valor and worth does indeed reach dominant society. After exploring the initiation ritual of the young men, the article then turns to explore the nature of the Philippines elite. This analysis suggests that while there are several, often competing strands within elite politics (legalistic, moralistic and clientelist), the efforts of the young men end up conforming and reproducing the elite and their own marginalization as unruly, uncouth goons of political machines. The author conducted fieldwork in Bagong Silang for a total of ten months. Over the course of his field work, he interacted with frat members, politicians and government officials. He was able to gain their trust and they shared their experiences about the brotherhood with him. The researcher was also allowed to observe some of the rituals of the fraternity." Jensen, S.

Explain your answers. ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The example above highlights several characteristics and strengths of qualitative research.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, qualitative research is able to provide rich, detailed and contextualized data about a particular phenomenon. In the article, the author was able to conduct ten months of fieldwork and interact with various stakeholders involved in the brotherhood, including frat members, politicians, and government officials. By doing so, the author was able to gain a deeper understanding of the social dynamics and cultural practices of the brotherhood, and to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the brotherhood and dominant society.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, qualitative research allows for the exploration and generation of new theories and hypotheses. In the article, the author draws on ritual and religious sacrifice theory to explain how sacrificial violence in initiation rites becomes a performance of worth. This theoretical framework is not explicitly stated in the literature on fraternities in the Philippines, and the author is able to generate new insights by applying this theory to the context of the brotherhood.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, qualitative research emphasizes the importance of context and subjectivity. In the article, the author recognizes that the experiences and perspectives of the young men in the brotherhood are shaped by their social, economic, and political context. The author also acknowledges that his own perspective and positionality as a researcher may influence his analysis and interpretation of the data.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the example above demonstrates the ability of qualitative research to provide in-depth and nuanced insights into complex social phenomena, and to generate new theories and hypotheses. It also highlights the importance of context and subjectivity in understanding social phenomena, and the need for researchers to critically reflect on their own positionality and biases.</p><br />

These works often seek to reclaim and reinterpret aspects of Philippine history and culture that have been marginalized or erased by colonialism.</p><p></p><p>Some significant literary movements or trends in 21st century Philippine literature include the rise of "new realism," which focuses on the everyday experiences of ordinary Filipinos, and the emergence of "speculative fiction," which combines elements of fantasy and science fiction with Philippine folklore and culture.</p><p></p><p>21st century Philippine literature uses language and form to convey meaning and emotion to readers in a variety of ways, including the use of vernacular language, experimentation with form and structure, and the incorporation of visual elements like graphic novels and comics.</p><p></p><p>Contemporary Philippine writers face a range of challenges, including limited access to publishing opportunities and the need to navigate complex political and social realities.
