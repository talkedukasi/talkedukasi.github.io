                                            News develops every day. The beauty of the newspaper in the classroom is that it is also fresh each day. It comes to you with the latest news and information and, unlike other media, comes beautifully written with lots of detail. Stories unfold as reporters unearth more information to reconstruct what happened. There is truly no better record of the world's happenings than a newspaper.For teachers the newspaper offers a special attraction. It has been called the living textbook and it lives up to that name. The newspaper can be used to enhance skills in reading, writing, listening, speaking, math, social studies and science. Critical thinking is the natural outgrowth of using a newspaper to learn. Unlike textbooks, which are several years outdated by the time they get into students' hands, the newspaper comes alive with information. The newspaper expands the curriculum with an unlimited amount of information to use as background for learning activities.These activities will help students improve their skills in reading and writing. These skills are among the ones they will practice: how to find the main idea, how to increase vocabulary, how to compare readings, how to form sentences, how to ask a good question and how to write a great summary. They will employ many critical thinking skills as they are required to interact with the authentic material found in the newspaper​</a>

                                            Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters we might normally employ when talking about our private life. What's more, thethings we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten.Source: SOCIAL MEDIA - 10th grade test - English ESL Worksheets for distance learningand physical classrooms (islcollective.com).  1.

                                            Answer:
The first picture shows poverty while the second one shows a sign of being able to afford recreational activities.
Explanation:
FIRST PICTURE
The father, together with his daughter in not-so-expensive clothing shows that they belong to the lower level of social status.
The father wears a hat that is used in farming. It only means that his major source of income is farming.
The way how he carries the bag shows that he works hours and hours in the field.
We can also identify that they live in a rural or provincial area based on how they dress up.
This shows that they belong to a family that can afford their needs but not their wants.
SECOND PICTURE
It seems like they are a couple who are on a vacation.
When you can afford it, you can do all the things you want aside from the things you need.
I can see that they are enjoying what they are doing as a result of hard work.
The way they dress and how healthy their complexion looks, we can really identify that they are wealthy.
Things like this picture are something that you need to pay for by clearly oberserving, we can see that are having a vacation at one of the attractions in a particular area.</a>

                            5. News develops every day. The beauty of the newspaper in the classroom is that it is also fresh each day. It comes to you with the latest news and information and, unlike other media, comes beautifully written with lots of detail. Stories unfold as reporters unearth more information to reconstruct what happened. There is truly no better record of the world's happenings than a newspaper.For teachers the newspaper offers a special attraction. It has been called the living textbook and it lives up to that name. The newspaper can be used to enhance skills in reading, writing, listening, speaking, math, social studies and science. Critical thinking is the natural outgrowth of using a newspaper to learn. Unlike textbooks, which are several years outdated by the time they get into students' hands, the newspaper comes alive with information. The newspaper expands the curriculum with an unlimited amount of information to use as background for learning activities.These activities will help students improve their skills in reading and writing. These skills are among the ones they will practice: how to find the main idea, how to increase vocabulary, how to compare readings, how to form sentences, how to ask a good question and how to write a great summary. They will employ many critical thinking skills as they are required to interact with the authentic material found in the newspaper​</h2><br />

                            6. Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters we might normally employ when talking about our private life. What's more, thethings we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten.Source: SOCIAL MEDIA - 10th grade test - English ESL Worksheets for distance learningand physical classrooms (islcollective.com).  1.

                            30. Answer:
The first picture shows poverty while the second one shows a sign of being able to afford recreational activities.
Explanation:
FIRST PICTURE
The father, together with his daughter in not-so-expensive clothing shows that they belong to the lower level of social status.
The father wears a hat that is used in farming. It only means that his major source of income is farming.
The way how he carries the bag shows that he works hours and hours in the field.
We can also identify that they live in a rural or provincial area based on how they dress up.
This shows that they belong to a family that can afford their needs but not their wants.
SECOND PICTURE
It seems like they are a couple who are on a vacation.
When you can afford it, you can do all the things you want aside from the things you need.
I can see that they are enjoying what they are doing as a result of hard work.
The way they dress and how healthy their complexion looks, we can really identify that they are wealthy.
Things like this picture are something that you need to pay for by clearly oberserving, we can see that are having a vacation at one of the attractions in a particular area.</h2><br />
