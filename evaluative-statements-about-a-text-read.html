Be sure to include examples from the text that support your evaluation.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The writer of this article presents a compelling argument in favour of the use of recycled wastewater. The writer’s thesis is that recycled wastewater is a reliable, cost effective and environmentally friendly water source that can be used in a wide range of applications. To support their claim, the writer provides evidence of how this technology has been successfully implemented in other places, such as California and Israel. Furthermore, they explain the process of turning wastewater into a safe and clean water supply, citing the benefits of reusing wastewater rather than disposing of it. The writer also points to the numerous environmental benefits associated with this technology, such as reducing the need to consume non-renewable water resources and reducing the amount of sewage being dumped into waterways. In my opinion, the writer’s argument is well-buttressed with important facts and research and their reasoning is sound. This article persuasively articulates the many potential benefits of using recycled wastewater and should be further explored in order to understand the potential the technology holds for more reliable and clean water access.</p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>Answered </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>Knowledge </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Valid </strong><strong>Opinions </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>help </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>guide </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>questioners.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>No </strong><strong>copies </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>anyone </strong><strong>nor </strong><strong>any </strong><strong>website</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />
