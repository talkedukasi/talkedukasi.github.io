“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

Paraphrase this reading material. </p><p></p><p>Essays come in two varieties: formal essays and informal essays, sometimes known as personal essays. In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
