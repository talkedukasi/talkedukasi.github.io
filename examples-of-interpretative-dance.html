                                            B. THE BRAIN The brain is the center of the nervous system. It interprets stimuli and tells the body how to react. The brain has three major parts. The part that controls balance, coordination and muscle movement is called the cerebellum. It makes sure that the muscles work well together. For example, a gymnast is able to balance on a beam because of the cerebellum. The medulla is a long stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It tells one’s body to do things without thinking about them. Digesting food or breathing even while asleep are examples of these involuntary actions. On the other hand, there are actions that one decides to do. It is the largest part of the brain—the cerebrum—that is responsible for these voluntary movements. Without it, one will not be able to kick a ball or dance at all. The brain might seem small but it is so powerful as it controls one’s entire body. Questions 1. Which is the best description of the brain? a. It makes people intelligent. b. It keeps one’s body healthy. c. It helps everyone think well. d. It dictates how the body will react to stimuli. 2. In the sentence, “The brain interprets stimuli,” the meaning of interpret is a. assign roles b. recall facts c. discuss ideas d. make sense of 3. What will the brain likely tell you if you happen to hold on to something hot? a. “I wonder how hot it is.” b. “Don’t drop it!” c. “Hold tight!” d. “Let go!” 4. Which is an example of involuntary action? a. circulating blood all over the body b. punching one’s classmate c. clapping your hands d. tickling your friend 5. Which part of the brain connects to the spinal cord? a. the nerves b. the medulla c. the cerebrum d. the cerebellum 6. What is the function of the cerebellum? a. It sends messages to the cerebrum. b. It connects the medulla to the cerebrum. c. It controls balance and muscle movements. d. It tells the parts of the body how they should function. 7. When you want someone to think of the right answer, you might say, a. “Use your senses.” b. “Sharpen your cerebrum.” c. “Give your medulla a job.” d. “Let your cerebellum function.” 8. What is the main idea of the selection? a. The brain controls the senses. b. The brain interprets all actions. c. The brain has three main parts. d. The brain controls one’s entire body​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>STREET</strong><strong> </strong><strong>DANCE</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Hip-hop dance refers to street dance styles primarily performed to hip-hop music or that have evolved as part of hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles which was created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin', Beat Street, and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called "new style"—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called "jazz-funk". Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to create choreography from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>INTERPRETATIVE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>DANCE</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Interpretive dance incorporates a wide variety of dance styles and techniques – the most important element being that it typically depicts a story or emotion.  Interpretive dance comes out of a modern dance tradition that began in the early 1900s.  This movement away from the traditional and constrictive ballet dancing was invented by dancers such as Isadora Duncan and Loie Fuller among others.  Along with the movement away from ballet, there was also a movement towards fitness and using dance in new ways.   Using gymnastics and other exercises to develop dance technique became more acceptable and popular.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>Tayo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ay</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Pilipino</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>Isang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lahi</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IT</strong><strong> </strong><strong>CAN</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HELP</strong><strong> </strong><strong>YOU</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>THANKS</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ME</strong><strong> </strong><strong>LATER</strong></p><br />

A multimodal text is one where the meaning is communicated by more than one mode - e.g.,written text, audio, still pictures, moving pictures, gesture, use of space, etc.3. Digital multimodal texts can include, for example, theatre, storytelling, and dance.4. Post-viewing prepares you to view by activating your schema, anticipating a message,predicting, speculating, asking questions, and setting a purpose for viewing.5. Viewing helps you build the expertise and skills to interpret and assess visual texts and interactivetexts that use visuals by slowing down, reflecting, and thinking about what you're seeing.​</h2><br />

                            28. B. THE BRAIN The brain is the center of the nervous system. It interprets stimuli and tells the body how to react. The brain has three major parts. The part that controls balance, coordination and muscle movement is called the cerebellum. It makes sure that the muscles work well together. For example, a gymnast is able to balance on a beam because of the cerebellum. The medulla is a long stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It tells one’s body to do things without thinking about them. Digesting food or breathing even while asleep are examples of these involuntary actions. On the other hand, there are actions that one decides to do. It is the largest part of the brain—the cerebrum—that is responsible for these voluntary movements. Without it, one will not be able to kick a ball or dance at all. The brain might seem small but it is so powerful as it controls one’s entire body. Questions 1. Which is the best description of the brain? a. It makes people intelligent. b. It keeps one’s body healthy. c. It helps everyone think well. d. It dictates how the body will react to stimuli. 2. In the sentence, “The brain interprets stimuli,” the meaning of interpret is a. assign roles b. recall facts c. discuss ideas d. make sense of 3. What will the brain likely tell you if you happen to hold on to something hot? a. “I wonder how hot it is.” b. “Don’t drop it!” c. “Hold tight!” d. “Let go!” 4. Which is an example of involuntary action? a. circulating blood all over the body b. punching one’s classmate c. clapping your hands d. tickling your friend 5. Which part of the brain connects to the spinal cord? a. the nerves b. the medulla c. the cerebrum d. the cerebellum 6. What is the function of the cerebellum? a. It sends messages to the cerebrum. b. It connects the medulla to the cerebrum. c. It controls balance and muscle movements. d. It tells the parts of the body how they should function. 7. When you want someone to think of the right answer, you might say, a. “Use your senses.” b. “Sharpen your cerebrum.” c. “Give your medulla a job.” d. “Let your cerebellum function.” 8. What is the main idea of the selection? a. The brain controls the senses. b. The brain interprets all actions. c. The brain has three main parts. d. The brain controls one’s entire body​</h2><br />
