                            10. Example of Showcasing complex ideas in motion information and media​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. •A form of media that has the appearance of moving text and graphics on a display. Its purpose is to communicate information in multiple ways •Motion media in essence is visual media that gives the appearance of movement. •Motion media can be a collection of graphics, footage, videos. It is combined with audio, text, and/or interactive content to create multimedia.
</p><p>2. • IT COMMUNICATES MESSAGE TO LARGE, HETEROGENEOUS, AND ANONYMOUS AUDIENCES. • IT COMMUNICATES THE SAME MESSAGE TO MASS AUDIENCES SIMULTANEOUSLY, SOMETIMES IN PUBLIC, OTHER TIMES IN PRIVATE. • IT EMBODIES MESSAGES THAT ARE USUALLY IMPERSONAL AND TRANSITORY. • IT IS MULTI-SENSORY SUCH THAT THE AUDIENCE’S SIGHT AND HEARING ARE STIMULATED IN CONCERT. SUCH A COMBINATION OF SENSORY STIMULI FORMS A COMPLEX SYNERGISM THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE COMMUNICATION. THIS POWERFUL DOUBLE-BARRELED COMBINATION OF DUAL-SENSE STIMULATION CONTRIBUTES IN LARGE MEASURE TO THE COMPELLING INFLUENCE OF MOTION MEDIA. • IT IS A FORMAL, AUTHORITATIVE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION. ACCORDINGLY, ITS POWER IN INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING LIES IN THE COMMUNICATOR’S ABILITY TO CONTROL VISUAL AND AURAL STIMULI. • IT IS INSTRUMENTAL IN BEHAVIOR AND ATTITUDE MODIFICATION – THAT IS, ATTITUDE FORMATION, CHANGE, CONSERVATION, AND CANALIZATION (DIRECTING A PERFORMED ATTITUDE TO A NEW DIRECTION) • IT CONFERS STATUS UPON ISSUES, PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS, OR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS.
</p><p>3. VIDEO FORMAT/VIDEO CODEC •MOTION MEDIA USE LARGE RESOURCES. CODECS COMPRESSES AND DECOMPRESSES VIDEO FILES. EXAMPLES: 3GP MPG MP4
</p><p>4. 3GP •THE 3GP (THIRD GENERATION PARTNERSHIP) VIDEO CONTAINER FORMAT WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE INTENTION TO SAVE ON DISK SPACE, BANDWIDTH, AND DATA USAGE, WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE OFTEN SEEN CREATED FROM, AND TRANSFERRED BETWEEN, MOBILE DEVICES. •THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF 3GP FORMAT IS THAT IT IS SMALL IN SIZE. THIS IS BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY FOR USERS WHO FREQUENTLY SAVE AND WATCH VIDEO FILES ON THEIR SMARTPHONES. AND DUE TO ITS SMALL FOOTPRINT, UPLOADING OR DOWNLOADING A VIDEO IN 3GP FORMAT WILL ONLY TAKE SECONDS TO MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE FILE SIZE.
</p><p>5. MPG •MPG IS A FILE EXTENSION FOR AN MPEG ANIMATION IN THE MPEG-1 OR MPEG-2 CODEC. MPEG-1 WAS DESIGNED FOR CODING PROGRESSIVE VIDEO AT BIT RATES OF ABOUT 1.5 MILLION BITS PER SECOND. IT WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR VIDEO-CD AND CD-I MEDIA. MPEG-1 AUDIO LAYER-3 (MP3) HAS ALSO EVOLVED FROM EARLY MPEG WORK. •MPEG-2 WAS DESIGNED FOR CODING INTERLACED IMAGES AT BIT RATES ABOVE 4 MILLION BITS PER SECOND. MPEG-2 IS USED FOR DIGITAL TV BROADCAST AND DVD. AN MPEG-2 PLAYER CAN HANDLE MPEG-1 DATA AS WELL.
</p><p>6. MP4 • MP4 IS A FILE FORMAT CREATED BY THE MOVING PICTURE EXPERTS GROUP (MPEG) AS A MULTIMEDIA CONTAINER FORMAT DESIGNED TO STORE AUDIOVISUAL DATA. THE MP4 IS LARGELY REPLACING EARLIER MULTIMEDIA FILE FORMATS, AND CREATING SOME CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT VENDORS SELL AUDIOVISUAL FILES TO THE PUBLIC. • MP4 FILE FORMAT, ALSO COMMONLY KNOWN AS MPEG-4 PART 14 OR MPEG-4 AVC (ADVANCED VIDEO CODING), IS A MULTIMEDIA FILE FORMAT USED TO DIGITALLY STORE AUDIO AND VIDEO FILES. MP4 FILE FORMAT IS ALSO USED FOR VIDEO STREAMING OVER THE INTERNET. MP4 FILE FORMAT IS BASICALLY A CONTAINER WHICH HOLDS AUDIO AND VIDEO FILES THAT ARE DIGITALLY ENCODED. MP4 FILE FORMAT HAS ONLY ONE OFFICIAL FILE EXTENSION, I.E., .MP4. THERE ARE TWO UNOFFICIAL FILE EXTENSIONS, AS WELL, NAMELY .M4A, WHICH IS AUDIO ONLY, AND .M4P, WHICH STANDS FOR THE PROTECTED MP4 FILE FORMAT.
