D. Mr. Ramos fixed his motorcycle for 60 minutes</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>D</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainlyplssssss</p>B. Mr. Ramos fixed his motorcycle for 40 minutes<br /><br />Explanation:<br />He started at 5:35 - one hour is equivalent to 60 minutes so we’ll subtract the minutes that Mr. Ramos took at that hour with 60 (60 - 35 = 25)<br />So 25 minutes for that hour. He ended to the next hour which is 6:15 so we’ll dd 25 minutes with the minutes took on the next hour (25 + 15 = 40) <br /><br />So Mr. Ramos took a total of 40 mins. to fix his own motorcycle.<br />

                        Answer:<p>Since Erwin used all his income for upgrading his motorcycle, the indications of him facing its consequences and obligation are there. Let's start by facing the consequences of getting broke when there is an emergency, and there are many what-ifs that might happen, and he should consider those things before using all his money for a material one. Second, as he may face the financial problem, he must face its burden. After meeting the consequences and obligations then should learn from his own mistakes and slips. With these, the next time he gets all his income, he may follow the 80/20 rule. 80% percent for what he needs and wants, 20% for savings. </p><p></p><p><strong>For more information, refer to these links:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15221552</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12861411</p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Distance word problems are a common type of algebra word problems. They involve a scenario in which you need to figure out how fast, how far, or how long one or more objects have traveled. These are often called train problems because one of the most famous types of distance problems involves finding out when two trains heading toward each other cross paths.</p><p></p><p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to solve train problems and a few other common types of distance problems. But first, let's look at some basic principles that apply to any distance problem.</p><br />
