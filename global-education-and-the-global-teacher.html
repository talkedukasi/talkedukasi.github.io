Speaking before the participants from the DepEd Central, Regional, and Schools Division offices, and schools, Briones talked about their chances of winning in both international and local competitions like the Global Teacher Prize (GTP) and Metrobank Foundation. 5 “Naisip ko madami naman tayong teacher na kayang-kaya mag-qualify. Madami naman tayong teacher na magagaling, nag-i-innovate, na naghihirap, na nagsa-sacrifice, walang complaint kung saan man sila naka-assign at saka nagsisilbi sa mga komunidad. At hindi lang iyon, nag-iisip sila ng mga panibagong paraan upang ma-reach ang learners,” Briones said. Organized by the International Cooperation Office (ICO), the forum aimed to promote GTP’s Ambassador Advocacies in education and to share expertise, teaching practices, approaches, and support systems in providing education to diverse learners. The forum’s objectives were to reinforce participation to GTP and other competitions; demonstrate best teaching practices and in developing teachers’ portfolio; share innovative solutions to education challenges; and to be acquainted with GTP finalists and awardees. The GTP underscores the importance of educators and the fact that, throughout the world, their efforts deserve to be recognized and celebrated. It also seeks to acknowledge the impact of the best teachers – not only on their students but also on their communities. “We have to recognize and support excellence. We have to recognize those who do different things, those who innovate, and those who go out of the box,” Briones added. Since GTP’s inauguration in 2015, there have been only four Filipino teachers who have made it to the final top 50. Answer the following questions: 1.

Do you think these concerns could besolved by teachers alone? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Meals. In many parts of the world, school feeding programs provide children with their most nutritious meal of the day. They are essential for the cognitive development and well-being. These programs are complex logistical and administrative endeavors. It is not easy, but countries should find the way to provide those meals using the school buildings in an organized fashion, community buildings or networks, or, if needed, distribute directly to the families. If delivering meals or food is not feasible logistically, cash transfer programs should be expanded or implemented to compensate the parents. Planning is needed, but one has to be ready to flexibly adjust plans, as the information we have about the likely paths of the pandemic change day by day, influenced by the uncertainty around which mitigation measures countries are taking. The process of reopening of schools might be gradual, as authorities will want to reduce agglomeration or the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic, which can affect some countries. In that uncertain context, it might be better to make decisions assuming a longer, rather than a shorter scenario. The good news is that many of the improvements, initiatives, and investments that school systems will have to make might have a positive long-lasting effect.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>its correct i hope it help plss give me a brainleast answer ty</p><br />

Speaking before the participants from the DepEd Central, Regional, and Schools Division offices, and schools, Briones talked about their chances of winning in both international and local competitions like the Global Teacher Prize (GTP) and Metrobank Foundation. 5 “Naisip ko madami naman tayong teacher na kayang-kaya mag-qualify. Madami naman tayong teacher na magagaling, nag-i-innovate, na naghihirap, na nagsa-sacrifice, walang complaint kung saan man sila naka-assign at saka nagsisilbi sa mga komunidad. At hindi lang iyon, nag-iisip sila ng mga panibagong paraan upang ma-reach ang learners,” Briones said. Organized by the International Cooperation Office (ICO), the forum aimed to promote GTP’s Ambassador Advocacies in education and to share expertise, teaching practices, approaches, and support systems in providing education to diverse learners. The forum’s objectives were to reinforce participation to GTP and other competitions; demonstrate best teaching practices and in developing teachers’ portfolio; share innovative solutions to education challenges; and to be acquainted with GTP finalists and awardees. The GTP underscores the importance of educators and the fact that, throughout the world, their efforts deserve to be recognized and celebrated. It also seeks to acknowledge the impact of the best teachers – not only on their students but also on their communities. “We have to recognize and support excellence. We have to recognize those who do different things, those who innovate, and those who go out of the box,” Briones added. Since GTP’s inauguration in 2015, there have been only four Filipino teachers who have made it to the final top 50. Answer the following questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A holistic approach to education – that addresses students’ learning, social and emotional needs – is crucial, especially in times of crisis. School closures related to the current COVID-19 pandemic mean that students from diverse backgrounds who are more at risk of increased vulnerability are less likely to receive the support and extra services they need, and the gap between students that experience additional barriers and that do not might widen. Closures can also have considerable effects on students’ sense of belonging to schools and their feelings of self-worth – these are key for inclusion in education.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow mo Ako ❤️</p><p></p><br />
