                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The diversity and richness of Philippine literature evolved side by side with the country’s history. This can best be appreciated in the context of the country’s pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions.        
</p><p>
</p><p>       The average Filipino’s unfamiliarity with his indigenous literature was largely due to what has been impressed upon him: that his country was “discovered” and, hence, Philippine “history” started only in 1521.
</p><p>
</p><p>       So successful were the efforts of colonialists to blot out the memory of the country’s largely oral past that present-day Filipino writers, artists and journalists are trying to correct this inequity by recognizing the country’s wealth of ethnic traditions and disseminating them in schools and in the mass media.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Before the Philippines was colonized, it was already – brimming with a rich tradition of oral literature. Early Filipinos weaved together countless myths and legends to explain certain phenomena in life. They had stories on how the world was created—why there is a sun in the morning and the moon at night, how a mountain was formed, why there are earthquakes, and other life events. However, because paper was not invented yet, many of these tales were not preserved and have vanished from local knowledge. Most of what have been transcribed now are taken from oral literature, which means that these stories have been passed on from one generation to another. Most of that which survived are epics and folklores. Here are their descriptions and other forms of literature that were passed on by the early Filipinos to today’s generation.</p><p></p><br />
