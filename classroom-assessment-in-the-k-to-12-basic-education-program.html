                                            With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS), which will comprise Grades 11 and 12 is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

                                            K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</a>

                                            Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1. What is the news all about? 2. What is your reaction about the news? 3. Do you agree or disagree with what the news stated?​</a>

                                            With the enactment of the K to 12 programs, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at th secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

Enrollment in senior high school (SHS), which will comprise Grades 11 and 12 is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Una, kailangan mong pumili ng currency pair: mahusay na gumagana rito ang EUR / USD.
</p><p>
</p><p>Maghanda para sa iyong unang trade: magtakda ng oras ng 1 minuto at halagang $1.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ngayon, magsimula ka nang mag-trade. Kailangan mong hulaan kung ang halaga ng palitan ay gagalaw sa direksyong UP o DOWN sa loob ng isang minuto matapos mong buksan ang trade.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sa estratehiyang ito, maaari kang magsagawa ng anumang hula kapag nagsimula ka. Hindi mahalaga kung pipiliin mo ang UP o DOWN.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sabihin nating pinili mo ang UP. Tandaan na hindi mahalaga kung anong pipiliin mo. 100% pa ring gumagana ang estratehiyang ito.
</p><p>
</p><p>Kung sa katotohanan ay gumalaw sa direksyong pataas ang tsart, tulad ng iyong nahulaan, makakakuha ka ng $1.92 sa iyong account (sa halip na iyong naunang isang dolyar!). Ngayon, kailangan mong gawin ang susunod mong trade, pero sa pagkakataong ito, kailangna mong piliin ang kasalungat na halaga: DOWN (hindi magbabago ang halaga at oras; panatilihing $1 at 1 minuto ang mga ito).
</p><p>
</p><p>Kaya sabihin nating sa kabilang direksyon gumalaw ang tsart at hindi naging matagumpay ang iyong trade. Nangangahulugan iyon na kailangan mong itaas ang susunod na trade sa $3 at palitan ulit ang direksyon ng tsart (hal. Kung DOWN ang huli mong pinili, kailangan mo na ngayong piliin ang UP);
</p><p>
</p><p>Hindi ulit gagalaw ang tsart tulad ng ninanais mo, at matatalo ka na naman sa trade na ito. Hindi ka dapat mag-alala dito (tandaan, sa estratehiyang ito, palagi mong kikitain ang anumang mawawala sa iyo!). Upang mabawi ang mga nawala sa iyo at kumita na ngayon, kailangan mong itaas ang trade sa $8 (huwag palitan ang oras ng trade). Tapos, piliin ang DOWN (dahil pinili natin ang UP noong huling pagkakataon).
</p><p>
</p><p>Mahusay! Sa pagkakataong iyon, pinili mo ang tamang direksyon at kumita ka ng $15.36 (nabawi mo na ang mga nawala sa iyo at kumita ka pa ng mas marami!). Ngayon, bumalik ka sa pagte-trade ng $1 at magsimulang muli. Sa pagkakataong ito, kailangan mong piliin ang UP. Iyon ang dahilan kung bakit tinatawag itong estratehiyang “up-down”.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job.

                            25. With the enactment of the K to 12 programs, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at th secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.
