                                            THE STORY OF THE AGED MOTHER A Japanese Folktale Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and their humble were peaceful and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not common. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought to second time about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was consider the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which is principal food for poor, cooked and dried it, and tying it in a square cloth, swung and bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and stated on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrowed road was crossed and recrossed by many pa made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they mingled in a confused puzzle, but he gave no heed. Or path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward- ever upward towards the high bare summ of what is known as Obatsuyama, "the mountain of the abandoning of aged". The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return mi one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequently intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth ge released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen p meedle, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifting his old mother therein, he wrapped her padded coat more c about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart said farewell. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. "Let not thin blinded, my son. "She said "The mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and follow the path which iles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar way farther down". The son's surprised eyes looked back ov ath, then at the poor old, shriveled hands ali scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote hin owing to the grounds, he cried aloud: "oh, Honorable mother, thy kindness thrusts my heart! I will not leav er we will die!"1. setting2. character3.conflic4.moral​</a>

</p><p>The setting of the story happened at the foot of the mountain in Shinano, a province in Japan where the mother and her son live. The story illustrates two important virtue-love and wisdom to us. Mother's love can't be compared to anything; she's pure and selfless. Most of all serves as our courage, weakness and strength which has guided us on our journey called life. Realism is used in this story because the story situation once occurred in Japan's history, not by putting the aged people to death but by abandoning them. </p><p>

                            6. THE STORY OF THE AGED MOTHER A Japanese Folktale Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and their humble were peaceful and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not common. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought to second time about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was consider the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which is principal food for poor, cooked and dried it, and tying it in a square cloth, swung and bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and stated on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrowed road was crossed and recrossed by many pa made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they mingled in a confused puzzle, but he gave no heed. Or path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward- ever upward towards the high bare summ of what is known as Obatsuyama, "the mountain of the abandoning of aged". The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return mi one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequently intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth ge released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen p meedle, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifting his old mother therein, he wrapped her padded coat more c about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart said farewell. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. "Let not thin blinded, my son. "She said "The mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and follow the path which iles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar way farther down". The son's surprised eyes looked back ov ath, then at the poor old, shriveled hands ali scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote hin owing to the grounds, he cried aloud: "oh, Honorable mother, thy kindness thrusts my heart! I will not leav er we will die!"1. setting2. character3.conflic4.moral​</h2><br />
