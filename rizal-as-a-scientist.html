Bata pa lang, marami na siyang wikang nalalaman at kayang bigkasin. Nahasa siyang magbasa ng mga literatura at kalaunan naging magaling din sa pagsusulat. Hindi lang ito ang pinagkaka-abalahan niya. Para palakasin ang pangangatawan, nag-aral siya ng mga pisikal na ehersisyo gaya ng fencing, martial arts at iba pa. Sa kanyang paglaki, mas lalo pang lumakas ang pagmamahal niya sa literatura kung kaya't sa kanyang paglalakbay ay bumibisita siya sa mga library ng lugar. O di kaya ay sinusulat niya ang mga kaganapan sa kanyang paglalayag. Ginugol niya ang kanyang libreng oras sa pagbabasa ng literatura ng ibang bansa at paglinang ng iba pa niyang kakayahan. Hindi lang sa literatura nabighani ang ating bayani. Pinasok din niya ang mundo ng medisina. Nag-aral siya at naging doktor sa mata. Marami ра siyang naging propesyon. Ilan dito ay ang pagiging inhenyero, scientist, geologist, manunulat, pintor, at marami pang iba. Ginamit niya ang kanyang galing sa pagsusulat upang pukawin ang mga Pilipino sa karahasan ng mga dayuhang mananakop. Katanungan: 1. Ano ang masasabi mo tungkol sa pagkatao ng ating Pambansang Bayani? 2. Batay sa teksto, ano-anong talento at kakayahan mayroon si Dr. Jose Rizal? 3. Paano ginamit ni Rizal ang kanyang kakayahan? Ipaliwanag. 4. Gamit ang talento at kakayahan ni Dr. Rizal, ano ang naiaambag niya sa bansang Pilipinas? Patunayan. 5. Kung may isang katangian si Rizal na nais mong tularan, ano yun at bakit?​</a>

The Sampaguita is known for its fragrance and the role it plays in the legends andtraditions of the Filipino people. This shrub was introduced into our country fromIndia. It is short-stemmed, and has glossy, hardy leaves six to twelve centimeterslong. The flowers are small, fragrant, pure white and glossy. They look like smallroses from a distance. This plant bears plenty of flowers in April, May, and June.12 Malunggay is horseradish. Did you know that poultice of malunggay leaves canbe used to decrease the swelling of sores and boils? A poultice is a soft compo-sition, such as with leaves, which can be applied over the swollen area of the skin.Malunggay is also used as a laxative. Laxative is a medicine taken to loosen thebowels.13. Climate is the overall state of weather in a place over a long period of time.Climate have changed over time in Earth's history. Climate change may be dueto changes in the amount of energy from the sun or the amount of dust in theatmosphere. In recent years, scientists have discovered that temperatures aregradually rising around the world. The trend is known as global warming. It isimportant to learn more about how climate changes because it affects theenvironment and way of life.14. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in someaspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the class-rooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should takeplace. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCDprojectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessons in the past werefrom print materials while lessons of today are from e-books and other onlineplatforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today arewhat matters most is how effective learning takes place.15 Spiders are small animals. Although they look like insects, they are not. Insects havesix legs; spiders have eight. Insects have feelers and wings, spiders do not havethese. Insect bodies have three parts, spider have two.16. There is no other Filipino like Jose Protacio Rizal. He was the greatest Filipino of thenineteenth century and possibly of the past and future generations as well. Hewas a shining example of the height and glory to which a Filipino could possiblyrise. Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19.1861. He came from a verywell-known and respected family of traders and farm owners.​</a>

                                            Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into the subunits, S1, and S2. S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RED) which allows coronaviruses to directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion. 1.

Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limitedto the epicenier and nearby cities of the earthquake.On Aug. 2, 1968, an earthquake, felt an intensity 8, had its epicenter inCasiguran, Aurora, but it was felt as far as Manila, where 270 people were killed and261 others were hurt mostly due to the collapse of the Ruby tower in the BinondodistrictThe 7.7 magnitude earthquake on July 16, 1990 shook the Northern part ofLuzon caused by Strikes and Slips in the Digdig Fault and with an epicenter in NuevaEcija province, the earthquake devastated Baguio city, which was 50 km awaySources Inquirer Archives Philvocs.gov.ph, pno gov.ph Kathleen de Villa and Mariolu Medinainquirer ResearchQuestions1.

                                            Coffee, a popular drink not only in the Philippines but in other places of the world as well; It has been described as unhealthy for ages. It might be the most readily available drink in both rural and urban areas, but most children are usually forbidden to drink it because it contains caffeine which affects the body, particularly the nervous system. Such a view, however, has been overturned by researches which point to the beneficial effects of coffee. Coffee is now considered a health drink. ...in the words of Tomas De Paulis, Ph.D., a research scientist at Vanderbilt University's Institute for coffee studies that conducts its medical research and tracks coffee studies around the world, "Coffee is more healthful than it is harmful. For most people, very little bad comes from drinking it, but a lot of good." (Kirchheimer, 2004) the trick is to enjoy coffee in moderation. - Jose Rizal O. Dapat.

The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake.

                            9. Si Jose Protacio Mercado Rizal y Realonda o mas kilala natin na Jose Rizal ay ipinanganak na may malaking ulo at sakitin. Sa mga kapatid niya, siya itong hindi nabugbog sa mga gawain sa bukid dahil sa kanyang kalusugan. Sa halip na nasa bukid, nasa bahay lang siya at ginugol ang sarili sa pag-aaral. Bata pa lang, marami na siyang wikang nalalaman at kayang bigkasin. Nahasa siyang magbasa ng mga literatura at kalaunan naging magaling din sa pagsusulat. Hindi lang ito ang pinagkaka-abalahan niya. Para palakasin ang pangangatawan, nag-aral siya ng mga pisikal na ehersisyo gaya ng fencing, martial arts at iba pa. Sa kanyang paglaki, mas lalo pang lumakas ang pagmamahal niya sa literatura kung kaya't sa kanyang paglalakbay ay bumibisita siya sa mga library ng lugar. O di kaya ay sinusulat niya ang mga kaganapan sa kanyang paglalayag. Ginugol niya ang kanyang libreng oras sa pagbabasa ng literatura ng ibang bansa at paglinang ng iba pa niyang kakayahan. Hindi lang sa literatura nabighani ang ating bayani. Pinasok din niya ang mundo ng medisina. Nag-aral siya at naging doktor sa mata. Marami ра siyang naging propesyon. Ilan dito ay ang pagiging inhenyero, scientist, geologist, manunulat, pintor, at marami pang iba. Ginamit niya ang kanyang galing sa pagsusulat upang pukawin ang mga Pilipino sa karahasan ng mga dayuhang mananakop. Katanungan: 1. Ano ang masasabi mo tungkol sa pagkatao ng ating Pambansang Bayani? 2. Batay sa teksto, ano-anong talento at kakayahan mayroon si Dr. Jose Rizal? 3. Paano ginamit ni Rizal ang kanyang kakayahan? Ipaliwanag. 4. Gamit ang talento at kakayahan ni Dr. Rizal, ano ang naiaambag niya sa bansang Pilipinas? Patunayan. 5. Kung may isang katangian si Rizal na nais mong tularan, ano yun at bakit?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Ang masasabi ko tungkol sa pagkatao ng ating pambansang bayani ay ako ay hangang hanga sa kanyang pagkatao at siya ay aking iniidolo sapagkat maraming propesyon ang kanyang sinubukan. Hanga din ako sa kanyang talino.literatura at pagsusulat, at mga pisikal na ehersisyo at marami pang iba.ginamit niya ang kaniyang kakayahan sa pamamagitan ng pagpasok sa ibat ibang klaseng propesyon.Nagsimula ng rebolusyon upang magkaroon ng kalayaan, at pinasiklab ang damdaming makabayan ng mga pilipino noong panahon ng kastila at dahil sa kanyang mga ginawa siya ay pinapatay.Ang pagiging mapagmahal sa bayan sapagkat kahit buhay niya ang kapalit hindi pa rin siya tumigil sa paggawa ng paraan upang magkaroon ng kalayaan ang ating bansa.<br />

                            10. B. Read the selections and identity each structure. Identity whether DESCRIPTION, COMPAREand CONTRAST, PROBLEM and SOLUTION, SEQUENCE and CAUSE and EFFECT.11. The Sampaguita is known for its fragrance and the role it plays in the legends andtraditions of the Filipino people. This shrub was introduced into our country fromIndia. It is short-stemmed, and has glossy, hardy leaves six to twelve centimeterslong. The flowers are small, fragrant, pure white and glossy. They look like smallroses from a distance. This plant bears plenty of flowers in April, May, and June.12 Malunggay is horseradish. Did you know that poultice of malunggay leaves canbe used to decrease the swelling of sores and boils? A poultice is a soft compo-sition, such as with leaves, which can be applied over the swollen area of the skin.Malunggay is also used as a laxative. Laxative is a medicine taken to loosen thebowels.13. Climate is the overall state of weather in a place over a long period of time.Climate have changed over time in Earth's history. Climate change may be dueto changes in the amount of energy from the sun or the amount of dust in theatmosphere. In recent years, scientists have discovered that temperatures aregradually rising around the world. The trend is known as global warming. It isimportant to learn more about how climate changes because it affects theenvironment and way of life.14. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in someaspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the class-rooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should takeplace. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCDprojectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessons in the past werefrom print materials while lessons of today are from e-books and other onlineplatforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today arewhat matters most is how effective learning takes place.15 Spiders are small animals. Although they look like insects, they are not. Insects havesix legs; spiders have eight. Insects have feelers and wings, spiders do not havethese. Insect bodies have three parts, spider have two.16.

                            14. Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into the subunits, S1, and S2. S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RED) which allows coronaviruses to directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion. 1.

Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show thatcoronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cellshave shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cellmembrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells.COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. Duringinfection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, Sl and S2. Si contains thereceptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to thepeptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion.What is the purpose of the text?a. explain how Covid-19 enters human cell.b. classify the different corona virus.c. entertain the readers about the effect of covid-19.2.

It might be the most readily available drink in both rural and urban areas, but most children are usually forbidden to drink it because it contains caffeine which affects the body, particularly the nervous system. Such a view, however, has been overturned by researches which point to the beneficial effects of coffee. Coffee is now considered a health drink. ...in the words of Tomas De Paulis, Ph.D., a research scientist at Vanderbilt University's Institute for coffee studies that conducts its medical research and tracks coffee studies around the world, "Coffee is more healthful than it is harmful.

The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake.
