It can also be said that every piece of propaganda is literature of a kind. The librarian, the collector of pamphlets, and whoever else is interested in all that is being thought and said—these ask, What is Literature? and do not wait for an answer. It is a good question, and so is another one: What is propaganda? There is even a third: What is the difference between them, and is this difference absolute</p><p></p><br />

                            4. Differentiate reform movement and revolutionary movement of the 19th century Philippines ​.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippine Revolution, (1896–98), Filipino independence struggle that, after more than 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, exposed the weakness of Spanish administration but failed to evict Spaniards from the islands. The Spanish-American War brought Spain’s rule in the Philippines to a close in 1898 but precipitated the Philippine-American War, a war between Filipino revolutionaries and the U.S. Army.</p><p></p><p>Numerous quasi-religious uprisings had punctuated the long era of Spanish sovereignty over the Philippines, but none possessed sufficient coordination to oust the Europeans. During the 19th century, however, an educated Filipino middle class emerged and with it a desire for Philippine independence. Opposition before 1872 was primarily confined to the Filipino clergy, who resented the Spanish monopoly of power within the Roman Catholic Church in the islands. In that year the abortive Cavite Mutiny, a brief uprising against the Spanish, served as an excuse for renewed Spanish repression. The martyrdom of three Filipino priests—José Burgos, Mariano Gómez, and Jacinto Zamora—for allegedly conspiring with the rebels at Cavite sparked a wave of anti-Spanish sentiment.</p><p></p><p>José Burgos</p><p>José Burgos, portrait on a Philippine postage stamp.</p><p>Photos.com/Jupiterimages</p><p>Reform-minded Filipinos took refuge in Europe, where they carried on a literary campaign known as the Propaganda Movement. Dr. José Rizal quickly emerged as the leading Propagandist. His novel Noli me tángere (1886; The Social Cancer, 1912) exposed the corruption of Manila Spanish society and stimulated the movement for independence.</p><p></p><p>José Rizal.</p><p>Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (neg. no. LC-USZ62-43453)</p><p>By 1892 it became obvious that Spain was unwilling to reform its colonial government. Andres Bonifacio, a self-educated warehouse clerk, organized a secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan, in Manila. Membership grew to an estimated 100,000 by August 1896, when the Spaniards discovered its existence. Bonifacio immediately issued a call for armed rebellion. The Spanish then arrested Rizal, who had advocated reform but never condoned the revolution. Rizal’s public execution, on December 30, 1896, so enraged and united Filipinos as to make permanent retention of power by Spain clearly impossible.</p><p></p><p>In March 1897 leadership of the revolution passed to a young general, Emilio Aguinaldo, who had Bonifacio shot for alleged sedition. Aguinaldo proved incapable of militarily defeating the Spanish troops, who were augmented by Filipino mercenaries. In the later months of 1897, Aguinaldo’s revolutionary army was pushed into the mountains southeast of Manila.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Emilio Aguinaldo.</p><p>Brown Brothers</p><p>On December 15, 1897, the pact of Biak-na-Bato was proclaimed. Though its precise terms have been a matter of impassioned debate ever since, the pact brought a temporary end to the Philippine Revolution. Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders accepted exile in Hong Kong and 400,000 pesos, plus Spanish promises of substantial governmental reforms, in return for laying down their arms. Neither side executed the terms of the pact in good faith. Aguinaldo used the money to purchase arms in Hong Kong, and the Spanish reneged on the promised reforms.</p><p></p><p>After the U.S. Navy commodore George Dewey annihilated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, Aguinaldo immediately returned to the Philippines. He began the revolution anew, this time against the United States, which had assumed title to the Philippines as a result of the Spanish defeat. Aguinaldo was captured in 1901 and subsequently appealed to Filipinos to cease fighting and accept U.S. sovereignty.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>please correct me if im wrong</p><br />

                            5. make a essay about Revolutionary Literature and the different factors that influenced it.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Revolutionary literature is a form of literature that emerged during times of political, social, and economic upheaval. It is a genre that reflects the ideas, values, and aspirations of the people who lived through these tumultuous times. Revolutionary literature is often characterized by vivid imagery, passionate language, and a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>There have been many factors that have influenced the development of revolutionary literature throughout history. One of the most significant factors is the political climate of the time. For example, during the American Revolution, writers such as Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson wrote influential works that challenged the authority of the British monarchy and advocated for American independence. Similarly, during the French Revolution, writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Victor Hugo wrote works that challenged the social and political order of their time.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that has influenced revolutionary literature is social and economic inequality. Writers often use literature as a tool to expose injustice, inequality, and oppression. For example, in the 19th century, writers such as Charles Dickens and Upton Sinclair wrote works that exposed the harsh realities of poverty and the exploitation of the working class. These works helped to raise awareness of social and economic issues and helped to inspire social movements for change.</p><p></p><p>Religion and spirituality have also played a significant role in the development of revolutionary literature. Many writers have used literature as a means of exploring religious and spiritual themes and questioning the role of religion in society. For example, during the Enlightenment period, writers such as Voltaire and Denis Diderot wrote works that challenged traditional religious beliefs and advocated for reason and science.</p><p></p><p>Finally, personal experience has also influenced the development of revolutionary literature. Many writers have drawn on their own experiences and struggles to create works that challenge established norms and empower marginalized groups. For example, in the 20th century, writers such as James Baldwin and Maya Angelou wrote works that explored issues of race and identity and helped to inspire the Civil Rights movement in the United States.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, revolutionary literature is a genre that has been shaped by many different factors throughout history. The political climate, social and economic inequality, religion and spirituality, and personal experience have all played significant roles in shaping this genre.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Nick Joaquin <p>Winning the National Artist award for Literature, Nick Joaquín is probably the most esteemed writer the Philippines has produced. Joaquin came from a well-educated family and was published at the early age of 17. After winning a scholarship in a nationwide essay contest, he left the Philippines to study in Hong Kong. On his return to Manila he worked for many years as a journalist, and his highly intellectual writing raised the standards of journalism in the country. Joaquin’s book, The Woman With Two Navels is essential reading in Philippine literature. However many of his short stories, such as “May Day Eve,” are extremely accessible and enjoyable for those new to the Philippines.</p>Jose Dalisay Jr.
<p>Jose Dalisay Jr. writes a popular online column where he’s more commonly known by his pen name, Butch Dalisay. Dalisay was imprisoned during Martial Law, and his experiences from this portion of Philippine history are brought to life in his first novel, Killing Time in a Warm Place. His second novel, Soledad’s Sister tackles the plight of overseas Filipino workers, and was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2007. Within the Philippines, Dalisay has won 16 Palanca Awards, the country’s highest prize for literature.</p>Jose Rizal
<p>The Philippines’ national hero was also a prolific writer, poet, and essayist. Jose Rizal’s two novels, Noli me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were social commentaries that sharply revealed the injustices of Spanish colonization while praising the Filipino in his most natural state. The novels, which are surprisingly wry and romantic, crystallized the growing anti-Spanish sentiment and were banned within the Philippines. The execution of Jose Rizal at 35 years old set off the Philippine Revolution and paved the way for the country’s independence. Even without these dramatic events, Rizal’s books and his final poem, “Mi Ultimo Adios,” stand on their own literary merit, and have influenced scores of Filipino writers since.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa heart and brainliest kung nakatulong</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Revolutionary literature has been one of the most powerful tools of expression throughout history. It has been known to stir up emotions, inspire action and motivate individuals to take a stand against oppression and injustice. The literature of revolutions, whether they are political, social or cultural, is deeply intertwined with the events that sparked them. It is shaped by the different factors that influence it, such as social, political and economic conditions, as well as the cultural and intellectual milieu of the time.</p><p></p><p>Social conditions play a major role in shaping revolutionary literature. Societal issues such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, and lack of basic human rights create an environment that fosters revolutionary thought. This form of literature often reflects a deep dissatisfaction with the existing social, economic and political order. It is through this dissatisfaction that individuals are compelled to take up the pen and express their discontent, as seen in works like the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.</p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliests </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>thank </strong><strong>you </strong><p></p><br />

                            27. similarities of revolutionary period and american period in the philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>BOTH SIDES GUSTO PATAYIN SI HENERAL LUNA AND REPUBLIKA NG PILIPINAS GUMAWA jk eto o</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Similarities</strong>
</p><p>1.) For one, our strong sense of religion has continued from the pre-hispanic times (Animism-Babaylan) to the colonial period (Catholicism-Priests).
</p><p>
</p><p>2.) Another continuity is that the Spaniards capitalized on our strong pre-hispanic maritime practice of boat building (karakoa) and incorporated it in their ship-building yards in Cavite (galleons) . Also, just as how our precolonial ancestors voyaged the seas and rivers, the Indios were also hired in the voyage of these galleons to Acapulco.
</p><p>
</p><p>3.) Prior to Spanish colonization, we already had strong trading ties with China — and the Spaniards again recognized and capitalized on this by keeping a restricted number of Chinese in Manila, for the sake of the Galleon Trade (80–90% of the Galleon’s contents were drawn from Chinese junk traders).
</p><p>
</p><p>4.) The former datus of the precolonial period, upon conquest, were co-opted by the Spaniards to join the new colonial order, by giving them positions in their government — making them Cabezas de Barangay, and giving them the title of Don in the process (these Datus will now collect taxes for the Spanish government, in exchange for privileges such as tax and forced labor exemptions)
</p><p>
</p><p>5.) And, how can we forget the continuity, and in fact exacerbation of regionalism under Spanish rule. Prior to colonialism, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries politically functioned around the Mandala system, with each Mandala being independent and autonomous from the other (in a sense, this is made manifest in the Philippine’s Bayan). However, upon Spanish and American conquest, they have recognized that the best way to pacify the islands was to make each of these centers fight for their own benefit — hence the divide and conquer policy.
</p><p>
</p><p>Yet, due to the colonial enterprise, we cannot deny the fact that cultural changes were imposed in the Philippines, altering numerous precolonial practices. Some of these important changes are:
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Differences</strong>
</p><p>1.) Gender inequality: prior to colonial rule, women had an equally important rule in the societal affairs of a bayan, with women playing the role of babaylan (cultural leader of the society). However, with the arrival of the Spanish priest, the babaylan’s cultural and religious role was undermined, and was simply relegated to the walls of the convent, or as assistants of priests.
</p><p>
</p><p>2.) Concept of Civilization: our houses back then were light and mobile bahay kubos and this is because we did not have strictly defined boundaries then, rather we followed the leader, who is the center of the Mandala system (Datus). Whereas in the pueblo, Filipinos were forced to live in concrete houses of bahay na batos, where the center of power now was both church and state, represented in how the pueblo is built around the plaza with the church and the town hall being in the center (hence a more permanent and settled conception of civilization — following the Western concept of Civitas: Cities).
</p><p>
</p><p>3.) Reduced Political Power of Filipinos: Though datus were co-opted into the Spanish administration as cabezas de barangay, their powers were now severely limited to that of tribute collection, devoid of their previous abilities and privileges to call men to arms, to have more than one wife, and have numerous slaves. This practice of denigrating Filipino political ability continued to the late 19th century with Filipinos being denied liberal reform. Even under the American regime, Filipinos were seen as incapable of self-rule, hence they were only given limited autonomy even during the Commonwealth period (we had no foreign affairs secretary under the Commonwealth hence we were not allowed to diplomatically interact with other nations — we still had to conduct our foreign affairs through the United States government).</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. What revolutionary influences do you recognize in the art literature and music of the 19th century?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Revolutionary influence in the literature of art and music of the 19th century</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Romantic movement of art and literature in the 19th </strong>century was influenced by revolutionary events such as the French and American revolutions. Romantic poets of the 18th century were influenced by many external influences but chief among them was the revolution that took place in France.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Aristoteles is of the view that the trend of romanticism leads to things that are extraordinary and cannot be explained about the cause and effect of why something can happen. <strong>Romanticism can also be said to be the basis </strong>of human thought that always wants a change to a certain condition. But it also depends on the selection of the way of looking, behavior, and human emotions.</p><p>The emergence of Romanticism in European history is always closely related to the great changes that occurred in the middle of the 18th century on the continent. <strong>The change in the political situation is considered to be</strong> one aspect of a wider change in society, and the Romantics were more aware of these changes than the artists of the previous generation.</p><p><strong>The Industrial Revolution at the end of the 18th </strong>century and the French Revolution at the beginning of the 19th century were the main causes of great changes in human life. Changes occur in the way of thinking and emotions felt by the European community. Changes then encourage differences in the way of looking at the human problems that occur around them. The artists then express their views through works of art, whether literature, music, stories, or pictures. Almost all regions of Europe experienced changes due to the spirit of Romanticism, but the greatest movement occurred in the regions of France, Germany, and England.</p><p> </p><p>More about 19th century art and music literature</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/27176916</p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
