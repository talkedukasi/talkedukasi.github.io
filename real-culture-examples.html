                                            (https.courses.lumenleaming.com/suny-hece-social problems)Schools ideally perform many important functions in modern society. These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.
