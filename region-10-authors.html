Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

the city’s residents. Suppose you were one of the engineers of the said project and your job was to renovate/improve the walkway, patio, and driveway. After your ocular inspection, you noticed that a rectangular floor measuring (10 m by 14 m) needed to be fixed. Likewise, your plan is to put brick paves to ensure that the walkway is strong and durable.
Consider the following:
1. Each piece of brick pave is a square with an edge of 50 cm. How many pieces of brick paves will be needed to cover the rectangular floor that needs fixing?
2. If one bag of adhesive cement for brick paves can cover 10 sq. m, how many bags of adhesive cement will be needed?
3. Make a model to illustrate the situation with appropriate mathematical
solutions.</a>

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

Your City Government Projects Office provides guidance and training for local governments, including municipalities or regional mobility authorities in the development of transportation projects. One of its current projects involves the construction of recreational facilities for
the city’s residents. Suppose you were one of the engineers of the said project and your job was to renovate/improve the walkway, patio, and driveway. After your ocular inspection, you noticed that a rectangular floor measuring (10 m by 14 m) needed to be fixed. Likewise, your plan is to put brick paves to ensure that the walkway is strong and durable.
Consider the following:
1. Each piece of brick pave is a square with an edge of 50 cm. How many pieces of brick paves will be needed to cover the rectangular floor that needs fixing?
2. If one bag of adhesive cement for brick paves can cover 10 sq. m, how many bags of adhesive cement will be needed?
3. Make a model to illustrate the situation with appropriate mathematical
solutions.</h2><br />
