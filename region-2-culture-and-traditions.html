                                            The lesson is an overview on the music of the Highlands and Lowlands of Luzon. Through the lessons, one will discover how the people from the different parts of Luzon express their feelings towards each other and the environment, their history, and their supernatural beliefs through the medium of the voice and/or musical instruments. A group performance inspired by examples of music from Luzon will culminate the educational experience. During the administration of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Executive Order 220 was ratified on 15 July 1987 to create the only landlocked region in the Philippines, the Cordillera Administrative Region, otherwise known as CAR. It is composed of SIX provinces, namely, Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mt. Province, with two cities, Baguio City, a highly urbanized city in Benguet and the regional center, and Tabuk City, a fifth-class city and the capital of Kalinga. The term "cordillera" was borrowed from Spanish word "cordilla" or "cuerda" which means "cord," "rope" or "chain." Hence, "cordillera" literally is an extensive chain of mountains or mountain ranges traversing the northern part of Luzori. This region is the majestic home to numerous ethnic peoples who are known for their unique culture most specifically for their music. music is very much a way of life. Indeed, it evidently reflects on every detail Their love of of their life cycle from birth to death and back. Consequently, their music is communal and participatory frequently performed in groups where all members of the ili are welcome and encouraged to join in the singing/chanting, dancing, and playing of the musical instruments. The songs/chants are sung in glottal or at other times in nasal registers, and these are also sung in solo or in leader-choir styles. Fortunately, the Cordilleran culture is one of the most colorful identities of the Philippines to be proud of and to reckon with. These traditions are on their way to extinction due to the modernization of the way of life among the youth of the Cordillera region. Less and less of the young generation are taught, learning the traditional music of their forefathers. Other threats to their music and most especially, their way of life are the conflict between state policies and their ancestral rights on land ownership, "mega-tourism", militarization, and the shift from manual farming to machine-processed farming. Despite all these, several non governmental organizations and international organizations like UNESCO ensure the protection not only of the rich culture and tradition of the Cordillera region but also of their people. Hudhud Ni Aliguyon - Chant Intro The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago. It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals. On the other hand, showcasing the rich oral traditions of the collective Cordilleran culture, it is through these narratives such as Hudhud, Owiwi, Sangsangit that the values and ethos of their forefathers and ancestors are handed down on them.LETS DO IT 1.)

Furthermore, the character 's existence could be identified not only by an actor performing a part but also by the make-up added to his face.

                            14. The lesson is an overview on the music of the Highlands and Lowlands of Luzon. Through the lessons, one will discover how the people from the different parts of Luzon express their feelings towards each other and the environment, their history, and their supernatural beliefs through the medium of the voice and/or musical instruments. A group performance inspired by examples of music from Luzon will culminate the educational experience. During the administration of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Executive Order 220 was ratified on 15 July 1987 to create the only landlocked region in the Philippines, the Cordillera Administrative Region, otherwise known as CAR. It is composed of SIX provinces, namely, Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mt. Province, with two cities, Baguio City, a highly urbanized city in Benguet and the regional center, and Tabuk City, a fifth-class city and the capital of Kalinga. The term "cordillera" was borrowed from Spanish word "cordilla" or "cuerda" which means "cord," "rope" or "chain." Hence, "cordillera" literally is an extensive chain of mountains or mountain ranges traversing the northern part of Luzori. This region is the majestic home to numerous ethnic peoples who are known for their unique culture most specifically for their music. music is very much a way of life. Indeed, it evidently reflects on every detail Their love of of their life cycle from birth to death and back. Consequently, their music is communal and participatory frequently performed in groups where all members of the ili are welcome and encouraged to join in the singing/chanting, dancing, and playing of the musical instruments. The songs/chants are sung in glottal or at other times in nasal registers, and these are also sung in solo or in leader-choir styles. Fortunately, the Cordilleran culture is one of the most colorful identities of the Philippines to be proud of and to reckon with. These traditions are on their way to extinction due to the modernization of the way of life among the youth of the Cordillera region. Less and less of the young generation are taught, learning the traditional music of their forefathers. Other threats to their music and most especially, their way of life are the conflict between state policies and their ancestral rights on land ownership, "mega-tourism", militarization, and the shift from manual farming to machine-processed farming. Despite all these, several non governmental organizations and international organizations like UNESCO ensure the protection not only of the rich culture and tradition of the Cordillera region but also of their people. Hudhud Ni Aliguyon - Chant Intro The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago. It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals. On the other hand, showcasing the rich oral traditions of the collective Cordilleran culture, it is through these narratives such as Hudhud, Owiwi, Sangsangit that the values and ethos of their forefathers and ancestors are handed down on them.LETS DO IT 1.)
