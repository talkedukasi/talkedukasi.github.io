I found it appealing in a way that one work of abstract art is equals to hundred of thoughts. Hundred of thoughts because abstract arts don't really show things that they really are. So from different people, different perspectives, different thoughts are made for a single art. I found abstraction also as an interesting one because it made me think about the real purpose of an artwork. You need to look at the very small details of it for you to come up with a idea that the artwork wants to express. And for me, that is really the essence of the every work of art. </p><p></p><p>For the importance of art, visit the link.</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/95312</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
