                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                                            Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</a>

The dealonly concerned military camps that already host facilities of Dito rivals Globe Telecomand Smart Communications, said Lorenzana.What is wrong with that argument? Lorenzana grossly fudges the issue by equatingChina Telecom with Globe and Smart, both of which are privately-run companies. ChinaTelecom, on the other hand, is under the control of the Beijing government, which overthe past years has grabbed Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea, militarized theregion, harassed Filipino fishermen, and unrelentingly undermined Philippine interestsas it has professed friendship and support toward a deferential Duterteadministrationeven5 Facts from the text1.2.3.4.5.5 Opinions after reading the text1.2.3.4.5.❤️</a>

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                            6. 11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

The first argument is that captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals, including blindness, skin problems, and stress-related diseases. The second argument is that captivity leads to boredom and limited space, which causes dolphins to abuse themselves by banging their heads against tank and aquarium walls. The third argument is that some of these marine mammals face abusive treatment from their caretakers, which shortens their lifespan. The fourth argument is that marine mammals breed poorly in captivity with high infant death rates.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: The essay concludes that marine mammals should not be held in captivity and that it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                            7. Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</h2><br />

The dealonly concerned military camps that already host facilities of Dito rivals Globe Telecomand Smart Communications, said Lorenzana.What is wrong with that argument? Lorenzana grossly fudges the issue by equatingChina Telecom with Globe and Smart, both of which are privately-run companies. ChinaTelecom, on the other hand, is under the control of the Beijing government, which overthe past years has grabbed Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea, militarized theregion, harassed Filipino fishermen, and unrelentingly undermined Philippine interestsas it has professed friendship and support toward a deferential Duterteadministrationeven5 Facts from the text1.2.3.4.5.5 Opinions after reading the text1.2.3.4.5.❤️</h2><br />

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.
