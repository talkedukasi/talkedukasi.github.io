                            4. Explain the concept and scope of movement education in relation to motor development and dynamic system theory.</h2><br />
                        Dynamic systems theory (DST) outlines three constraints (i.e. individual, task, and environment) that influence the emergence of behavior. These constraints interact with one another to self-organize and create a spontaneous behavior. For many researchers studying motor development, this spontaneous behavior refers to the production of motor movement. DST provides an explanation for the variability and spontaneous movement that occurs from individual to individual. While this theory is accepted as one of the major explanations of motor development, it is unknown how it is being utilized to inform the research on motor development or the development of interventions. In this review, the author found 18 instances in the literature where DST had been used to analyze, test, or manipulate motor patterns and movement. Overall, the studies report a positive effect from the manipulation of constraints with respect to a change in motor pattern. Only one study was found that sought to positively improve behavior through the directed use of constraints; the majority of studies sought to understand the influence constraints have on the production of movement.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning is defined as a process that brings together personal and environmental experiences and influences for acquiring, enriching or modifying one’s knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, behaviour and world views. Learning theories develop hypotheses that describe how this process takes place. The scientific study of learning started in earnest at the dawn of the 20th century.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Parsons views social change as a process of 'social evolution' from simple to more complex form of society. Social evolution involves a process of social differentiation. The institutions arid roles which form the social system become increasingly differentiated and specialised in terms of their function.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The functionalists believed that Darwin's theory applied to psychological characteristics too. Just as some animals have developed strong muscles to allow them to run fast, the human brain, so functionalists thought, must have adapted to serve a particular function in human experience.Sep 11, 2015.</p><p> While the evolutionary perspective draws on Darwinian principles of evolution and natural selection to explain how gender differences evolve. Individuals who are fertile, live long enough to reproduce, and are able to raise their offspring will successfully pass on their characteristics to the next generation.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is difficult to determine the impact of a specific theory on learners' skills and personality development without knowing the specifics of the theory in question. Different theories of learning and development may have different implications for learners' skills and personality development depending on their underlying assumptions and conceptual frameworks.</p><p></p><p>For example, a theory that emphasizes the role of experiences and interactions in shaping learning and development may suggest that learners' skills and personality are shaped by the kinds of experiences they have and the ways in which they engage with their environment. On the other hand, a theory that emphasizes the role of innate abilities and genetics in shaping learning and development may suggest that learners' skills and personality are largely determined by their genetic makeup and that experiences may play a less important role.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the impact of a theory on learners' skills and personality development will depend on the specific assumptions and conceptual frameworks of the theory and how it is applied in practice.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> paki ayus pagtatanong Nyo sa sunod salamat</p><p></p><br />

                            25. How will you apply the theory of Piaget and Vygotsky in the teaching learning process?
And what do you think are the impact of these theories to the learners and personality development?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The theories of Piaget and Vygotsky are influential approaches to understanding child development and learning. Here are some ways in which these theories can be applied in the teaching and learning process:</p><p></p>Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggests that children go through a series of stages as they develop their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers can use this understanding to provide appropriate challenges and activities that are aligned with the cognitive abilities of their students.Vygotsky's theory of social development emphasizes the role of social interaction and culture in learning. Teachers can use this understanding to create collaborative learning environments that encourage students to work together and learn from each other.Both Piaget and Vygotsky's theories suggest that children are active learners who construct their own understanding of the world. Teachers can use this understanding to design hands-on, experiential learning activities that allow students to explore and discover concepts on their own.<p></p><p>The impact of these theories on learners and personality development can be significant. By understanding how children develop and learn, teachers can create more effective and engaging learning environments that support the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This can have a positive impact on learners' overall academic and personal development.</p><p></p><p><strong>ps: brainliest this, thanks!!</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The theories of Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky are influential frameworks for understanding child development and learning. These theories can be applied in the teaching-learning process in various ways.</p><p></p><p>According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children go through a series of stages as they develop their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers can use this theory to tailor their instruction to the cognitive abilities of their students. For example, teachers may provide more concrete examples and hands-on activities for younger students, who may be more concrete thinkers, and more abstract and complex tasks for older students, who may be more capable of abstract thought.</p><p></p><p>Vygotsky's theory of sociocultural development emphasizes the role of social interactions and cultural context in learning. Teachers can use this theory to create learning environments that foster collaborative learning and support the development of higher-order thinking skills. For example, teachers can use techniques such as scaffolding, in which they provide support and guidance to students as they tackle increasingly complex tasks, and gradually reduce that support as students become more independent learners.</p><p></p><p>Both Piaget's and Vygotsky's theories have had a significant impact on the field of education and have influenced the way teachers approach teaching and learning. These theories can help teachers better understand the cognitive and social-emotional needs of their students and provide more effective instruction that meets those needs. They can also help students develop their thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as their social and cultural awareness, which can contribute to their overall personality development.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            26. 4. Discuss the concepts and theories related to physical growth and motor development of children and adolescents.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Overall, the studies found a positive association between fundamental motor skills and physical activity in children and adolescents, as well as a positive relationship between fundamental motor skills and cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Physical Development in Children and Adolescents<p>Physical development is the most readily visible of the child development domains.  Parents notice height and weight as well as the development of both fine motor and gross (large) motor skills.  It’s important to remember that what we can see physically corresponds to what we can’t see which is brain development.  In all developmental domains, the brain is promoting exploration and movement but when exploration and movement occur it also stimulates brain development including both neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) and synaptogenesis (forming new connections between brain cells).  In fact at various times during the first few years of life, a baby’s brain produces so many connections that they end up with more than in an adult brain.  Later through a process called pruning, synaptic connections that are not used by the child are eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Parents play an important role in all of the developmental domains and physical development is equally important.  Parent’s bonding with their child develops a sense of feeling safe to explore and positive feedback encourages a child to reach out more and push harder.  Parents also provide guidance and support through a process known as “scaffolding”.  Providing objects to encourage a baby to reach and grasp, holding the hands of a toddler while they take a few steps, teaching potty training, help a child with buttoning and zipping clothing, helping them learn to ride a bike and playing catch are just a few examples of how parents provide scaffolding to help children develop physical abilities.</p><p></p><p>In addition to encouraging and teaching specific skills, parents should promote a healthy lifestyle for their children.  This includes helping them to get adequate sleep, eat a well-balanced diet and stay active physically.  In this endeavor, the best approach for parents to take is to model the behavior as well as teach and encourage these very important health habits.  Teaching safety and maintaining a safe home environment (especially in the early years) is also very important.  Keeping up with regular check-ups and keeping immunizations up to date is important as well.</p><p></p><p>If you are concerned about possible delays in your child’s physical development we suggest you use the American Academy of Pediatrics: Motor Delay Tool and then discuss any concerns you have with your pediatrician.</p><p></p>Tips for ParentsA Few Things Parents Can Do To Promote Physical DevelopmentPlay with your child.  Play games that encourage physical development.  With baby’s, it could be as simple as showing them an interesting object and encouraging them to grab it and cheering them as they try.  Later it is playing outdoor games that encourage skills.For great ideas for play activities that encourage physical development as well as other types of development we highly recommend the Gymboree Play and Learn Series.Provide your child with toys as well as simple household objects that will encourage physical play.When they are ready take them to the park.  Let them run.  Run with them.  Let them play on the equipment like the swings and slides.If you have a pool, leave in a complex with a pool or visit friends with a pool or live near natural bodies of water, teach your child to swim at an early age.  Check around for programs near you.During the summer, make use of programs offered by local recreation and parks department and often community colleges as well that offer all types of instruction in sports and other physical activities.Learn yoga as a family, get a video and go for it.Go hiking as a family.Can’t always play outside?  Get Wii Fit and enjoy as a family.  Each member should set their own individual goals and encourage each other as well.Buy toys that are age appropriate and that encourage physical development and outdoor play here are some suggestions:  Sports and Outdoor Toys by Age GroupEncourage the development of fine motor skills by providing age-appropriate art materials.Encourage your child to try out different organized sports.  Hopefully, they will find one or two they enjoy.Limit screen time.  Encourage physical activities and playing with “real toys” rather than “virtual toys”.  These two books provide some useful suggestions:  Screen Time: How Electronic Media–From Baby Videos to Educational Software–Affects Your Young Child and   Reset Your Child’s Brain: A Four-Week Plan to End Meltdowns, Raise Grades, and Boost Social Skills by Reversing the Effects of Electronic Screen-Time.Encourage your child to participate in after-school sports.Encourage your child to participate in scouts.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana po makatulong</p><p>Follow for more!</p><p>God bless y'all</p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po </p><br />
