Which among the categories of the Tropical Cyclone is the most destructive? Why? 2. What do you mean by PAGASA? How can PAGASA help us? 3. If you are located within the eye of the typhoon what will be the wind speed? What about the air pressure? 4. What conditions are needed for tropical cyclones to form? 5. How typhoons are formed or developed?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The most destructive category of the Tropical Cyclone is the Super Typhoon. This is because the wind speeds of a Super Typhoon are typically over 250 km/h and the storm surge of a Super Typhoon can reach up to 10 meters in height. This makes it the most destructive of the categories. </p><p></p><p>2. PAGASA stands for the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. This organization is responsible for providing weather forecasts and issuing tropical cyclone warnings in the Philippines. They can help us by providing us with up-to-date information on tropical cyclones and the potential impacts they may have. </p><p></p><p>3. If you are located within the eye of the typhoon, the wind speed would be very low or non-existent. The air pressure in the eye of the typhoon is typically much lower than the surrounding air pressure. </p><p></p><p>4. The conditions needed for tropical cyclones to form are warm ocean waters, high humidity, light winds, and a pre-existing system of low air pressure. </p><p></p><p>5. Typhoons are formed or developed when a low-pressure area, which has the necessary conditions for a tropical cyclone, develops over tropical or subtropical waters. The warm, moist air rises and the air pressure drops, resulting in a low-pressure area. This low-pressure area is then further developed by the Coriolis effect and the release of latent heat. The winds associated with the low-pressure area increase and form the typhoon.</p><br />
