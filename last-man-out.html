Just then a man came walking along the road.
The sun said, "I see a way to decide who is right. Whichever one of us can make that man
take off his coat would be stronger. You begin."
So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind began to blow on the man as hard as it could.
But the harder it blew the more closely the man wrapped his coat around him. At last, the
wind had to give up.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

Just then a man came walking along the road.
The sun said, "I see a way to decide who is right. Whichever one of us can make that man
take off his coat would be stronger. You begin."

But the harder it blew the more closely the man wrapped his coat around him. At last, the
wind had to give up.
Then the sun came out from behind the cloud and shone in all its glory upon the man. The
man walked for a while. Then he found he was too hot. He took off his coat.</h2><br />

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.
