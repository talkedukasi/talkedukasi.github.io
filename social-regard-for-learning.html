HOW TO LEARN?Directions: Read the Allegory of the Cave, an extract in Plato's The Republic andexplain your understanding regarding the text.ALLEGORY OF THE CAVEAll of us have an individual cave in our own where we live a comfortable,happy and familiar life.But in reality, we are prisoners of the truth, we prefer living a dull, mundanelife and blindly follow the set of social norms than question or challenge theauthenticity of the shadows that we've seeing since childhood.If you want to learn, be prepared for a difficult journey, and be prepared tomake some mistakes. That's okay! It's all part of the process.True knowledge must be obtained the hard way, and some people justdon't want to see the light.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p>1.) my stand regarding this issue is Exploring and drilling for oil may disturb land and marine ecosystems. Seismic techniques used to explore for oil under the ocean floor may harm fish and marine mammals. Drilling an oil well on land often requires clearing an area of vegetation.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If there is oil exploration, taxes are paid to the local government. </p><p></p><p>The condition that needs to be met is oil exploration. And as is proper, the business should pay the appropriate tax to the local government</p><p></p><p>2.) Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So, a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If quarrying happens erosion happens </p><p></p><p>Quarrying is the condition that needs to happen for erosion to happen </p><p></p><p>3.) Covid-19 is the virus that's spread all over the world, It can make you suffer and also it can make you die.

Traditionally, distance learning has been defined as when an instructor is located in a different place from the learner. Often discussed with other terms such as virtual, online, or open learning, distance learning emerged along with the technologies that enabled it.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If the seats of the children's are not close to each other while learning. </p><p></p><p>5.) The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*when a criminal receives a lethal injection for committing three murders.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yan po ang sagot ko sana po makatulong </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Oil and gas drilling has a serious impact on our wildlands and communities. Drilling projects operate around the clock generating pollution, fueling climate change, disrupting wildlife and damaging public lands that were set aside to benefit all people.   Quarrying creates pollution from noise and dust                                                                  Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.The disadvantages of the distance aspect include: lack of personal contacts between the teacher and students [1, 17, 15, 11, 2, 4], lack of contacts between students [15], problems with cheating and identification of students [1, 9, 2], lack of direct control [9, 15], lack of students individual characteristicsHere are five reasons why the death penalty is wrong:#1. It's inhumane. ... #2. The death penalty disproportionately affects certain groups. ... #3. The death penalty can be used as a tool for control, not justice. ... #4. It can't be undone if new evidence is revealed. ... #5. It doesn't deter crime.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p></p><p>1.) my stand regarding this issue is Exploring and drilling for oil may disturb land and marine ecosystems. Seismic techniques used to explore for oil under the ocean floor may harm fish and marine mammals. Drilling an oil well on land often requires clearing an area of vegetation.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If there is oil exploration, taxes are paid to the local government. </p><p></p><p>The condition that needs to be met is oil exploration. And as is proper, the business should pay the appropriate tax to the local government</p><p></p><p>2.) Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So, a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If quarrying happens erosion happens </p><p></p><p>Quarrying is the condition that needs to happen for erosion to happen </p><p></p><p>3.) Covid-19 is the virus that's spread all over the world, It can make you suffer and also it can make you die. Covid-19 is the virus that </p><p>hard to fight because you can't see it</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If the people are vaccinated, they are more protected from the virus </p><p></p><p>*If the hospitals are not overwhelmed, people can receive attention even for other conditions and treatments </p><p></p><p>*If i were the victims, I would feel bad about myself </p><p></p><p>4.) Traditionally, distance learning has been defined as when an instructor is located in a different place from the learner. Often discussed with other terms such as virtual, online, or open learning, distance learning emerged along with the technologies that enabled it.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*If the seats of the children's are not close to each other while learning. </p><p></p><p>5.) The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution.</p><p></p><p>[EXAMPLE] </p><p></p><p>*when a criminal receives a lethal injection for committing three murders.</p><br />

Using the Holland's career development theory, I have discovered that I have a social personality type. This means that I enjoy working with people and helping them to solve problems. I also value social relationships and prefer jobs that involve interpersonal communication and collaboration. This has helped me to narrow down my career options and focus on jobs that align with my personality type.</p><p></p><p>Another thing I have learned about myself is my strengths and areas of development. Through the use of self-assessment tools such as SWOT analysis and skills inventory, I have been able to identify my strengths such as problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills. I have also identified areas that need improvement such as time management and networking skills. This has helped me to develop a plan to enhance my skills and address my development needs.</p><p></p><p>My Intended Career Goals</p><p></p><p>My intended career goal is to become a social worker. The inspiration for this career choice comes from my passion for helping people, particularly those who are vulnerable and marginalized in society. I believe that as a social worker, I can make a positive impact on people's lives by providing support, advocacy, and empowerment. I have also been inspired by the stories of social workers who have made a difference in their communities and have helped to bring about social change.</p><p></p><p>What I Need to Do to Achieve My Career Goals</p><p></p><p>To achieve my career goals, I need to acquire the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications. One of the things I need to do is to gain practical experience through internships and volunteering opportunities. This will provide me with an opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and develop my skills in a real-world setting. I also need to develop my communication, networking, and time management skills to be an effective social worker.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualifications, I need to complete a degree in social work and obtain a license to practice as a social worker. I also need to continue my professional development by attending workshops, seminars, and training programs to enhance my knowledge and skills. Additionally, I need to develop personal attributes such as empathy, compassion, and resilience to be able to work effectively with clients and manage the emotional demands of the job.</p><p></p><p>My Current Skills</p><p></p><p>Currently, I possess a range of skills that are relevant to my intended career as a social worker. I have strong communication skills, both verbal and written, which will be essential in working with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. I also have good problem-solving skills, which will enable me to identify and address the needs of my clients. Additionally, I have leadership skills, which will be useful in managing teams and advocating for social change.</p><p></p><p>My PDP</p><p></p><p>My personal development plan (PDP) involves a range of activities that will help me to achieve my career goals. These include gaining practical experience through internships and volunteering, attending workshops and training programs, and developing personal attributes such as empathy and resilience. I also plan to improve my networking skills by attending networking events and building relationships with professionals in the field. Additionally, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a master's degree in social work to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Career Planning for Social Science unit has been a valuable learning experience for me. Through the use of career development theory, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and my intended career goals. I have also developed a plan to achieve my career goals by acquiring the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Health Service Providers are the modern heroes that we should be proud of nowadays. In the battle with the global pandemic, many of our front liners have sacrificed their lives in order to bring service to those who are very sick in the hospitals. They have been exhausted since the very first day the virus struck us and we have lost many of them. They have dedicated their time and service unselfishly, staying in hospitals, wearing layers of protective gear, and staying by the side of our family members who we cannot be with because of the virus. It is true that not all heroes wear capes, instead, you can find them in hospitals, tired, weary, and exposed to the virus but unselfishly still giving service to the people. </p><p>Health care plans are very important because it gives the assistance that we need especially during unexpected times. No one can tell when one would be hospitalized but health care plans aids the finances of the patient and makes things a little easier. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Health Care plans</strong> are any programs that help to pay medical expenses paid through private insurance, social insurance, or social welfare program funded by the government. Other terms for this are health insurance, health coverage, and health benefits. </p><p><strong>Health Service Providers </strong>- they are those doing activities such as diagnosing or treating illness or disability. These also include those who assist in providing medical services, samples of which are doctors, nurses and caregivers. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><br />
