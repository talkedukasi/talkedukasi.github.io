Study reveals internet can ruin family relationships
Can the Internet be a source of conflicts? A new study from online security firm says yes, and it does not just affect intimate relationships but family relationships as well.
Previous researches have revealed that children on average spend six hours or more glued to the screens of their devices.
Kaspersky Lab and iconKids &amp; Youth researchers surveyed over 3,700 families in seven countries to know about how the internet is affecting their personal relationship with their children.
One in four of the parents surveyed say that their kids now prefer to go online rather than talk to them, with one in three parents believing the internet isolates them from their children. All in all, a fifth of parents and children say that the internet can cause family tension.
"It is only natural that using—and misusing—each other’s connected devices can become a cause of conflict for families. However, as we spend more and more time online, family dynamics are also changing. It is important that families maintain an ongoing dialogue about how to spot and respond to potential dangers, with parents and children together agreeing on the basic rules on how they can best navigate the digital world,” said Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab.
The survey also reveals that the problem may be worsened in the following cases:
If the device used by both parents and children gets broken,
If the device is accidentally infected by a virus while online,
If the parents had to pay for something their child had ordered or downloaded, and
If the parents had accidentally deleted some of their children's data
Janice Richardson, senior advisor at European Schoolnet, said that although the internet becomes a source of conflict in some families, siblings and extended family members take on a much bigger role in children's online activities.
"Children are instinctively turning to the person they perceive to be able to fix technical issues, advise on sites and security tools and provide more objective responses to delicate queries,” Richardson said, citing a recent study by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.
She said that given the emerging trend, the importance of parents and guardians developing their own technical competence and building trusting relationship with their kids grow.
"At the same time, software and social media providers, too, should seek to develop more ‘family-friendly’ tools,” Richardson added. — Alixandra Caole Vila</a>

Study reveals internet can ruin family relationships
Can the Internet be a source of conflicts? A new study from online security firm says yes, and it does not just affect intimate relationships but family relationships as well.
Previous researches have revealed that children on average spend six hours or more glued to the screens of their devices.
Kaspersky Lab and iconKids &amp; Youth researchers surveyed over 3,700 families in seven countries to know about how the internet is affecting their personal relationship with their children.
One in four of the parents surveyed say that their kids now prefer to go online rather than talk to them, with one in three parents believing the internet isolates them from their children. All in all, a fifth of parents and children say that the internet can cause family tension.
"It is only natural that using—and misusing—each other’s connected devices can become a cause of conflict for families. However, as we spend more and more time online, family dynamics are also changing. It is important that families maintain an ongoing dialogue about how to spot and respond to potential dangers, with parents and children together agreeing on the basic rules on how they can best navigate the digital world,” said Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab.
The survey also reveals that the problem may be worsened in the following cases:
If the device used by both parents and children gets broken,
If the device is accidentally infected by a virus while online,
If the parents had to pay for something their child had ordered or downloaded, and
If the parents had accidentally deleted some of their children's data
Janice Richardson, senior advisor at European Schoolnet, said that although the internet becomes a source of conflict in some families, siblings and extended family members take on a much bigger role in children's online activities.
"Children are instinctively turning to the person they perceive to be able to fix technical issues, advise on sites and security tools and provide more objective responses to delicate queries,” Richardson said, citing a recent study by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.
She said that given the emerging trend, the importance of parents and guardians developing their own technical competence and building trusting relationship with their kids grow.
"At the same time, software and social media providers, too, should seek to develop more ‘family-friendly’ tools,” Richardson added. — Alixandra Caole Vila</a>

However, this practice has been gradually disappearing because of the advent of technology. Young people would rather use social media to express themselves for they are embarrassed to share their feelings to their parents. On the other hand, parents are somehow guilty of contributing to the distance felt by their children for some of them are too busy with work such as taking office calls during meal time, checking emails or surfing the internet. Because of these, there is lesser time for families to spend together. This must change We must not let technology affect the time we spend with them. Doing this will create better and stronger relationships.Need  now ​</a>

Study reveals internet can ruin family relationships
Can the Internet be a source of conflicts? A new study from online security firm says yes, and it does not just affect intimate relationships but family relationships as well.
Previous researches have revealed that children on average spend six hours or more glued to the screens of their devices.
Kaspersky Lab and iconKids &amp; Youth researchers surveyed over 3,700 families in seven countries to know about how the internet is affecting their personal relationship with their children.
One in four of the parents surveyed say that their kids now prefer to go online rather than talk to them, with one in three parents believing the internet isolates them from their children. All in all, a fifth of parents and children say that the internet can cause family tension.
"It is only natural that using—and misusing—each other’s connected devices can become a cause of conflict for families. However, as we spend more and more time online, family dynamics are also changing. It is important that families maintain an ongoing dialogue about how to spot and respond to potential dangers, with parents and children together agreeing on the basic rules on how they can best navigate the digital world,” said Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab.
The survey also reveals that the problem may be worsened in the following cases:
If the device used by both parents and children gets broken,
If the device is accidentally infected by a virus while online,
If the parents had to pay for something their child had ordered or downloaded, and
If the parents had accidentally deleted some of their children's data
Janice Richardson, senior advisor at European Schoolnet, said that although the internet becomes a source of conflict in some families, siblings and extended family members take on a much bigger role in children's online activities.
"Children are instinctively turning to the person they perceive to be able to fix technical issues, advise on sites and security tools and provide more objective responses to delicate queries,” Richardson said, citing a recent study by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.
She said that given the emerging trend, the importance of parents and guardians developing their own technical competence and building trusting relationship with their kids grow.
"At the same time, software and social media providers, too, should seek to develop more ‘family-friendly’ tools,” Richardson added. — Alixandra Caole Vila</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Excessive eating of many processed, high-fat foods, may be the cause of this phenomenon. Overweight or obese children are more likely to enter puberty early. Some evidence suggests that obesity can accelerate the onset of puberty in girls and may delay the onset of puberty in boys. Moreover, the progression of puberty is affected by nutrition. On the other hand, puberty triggers a growth spurt, which increases nutritional needs including macro and micronutrients. Increased caloric, protein, iron, calcium, zinc and folate needs have to be provided during this critical period of rapid growth.</p><br />

Directions: Identify the adjectives used in the following paragraph that convey emotional response or reaction As Filipinos, we love to be with our family during dinner time to share our best or worst experiences of the day. However, this practice has been gradually disappearing because of the advent of technology. Young people would rather use social media to express themselves for they are embarrassed to share their feelings to their parents. On the other hand, parents are somehow guilty of contributing to the distance felt by their children for some of them are too busy with work such as taking office calls during meal time, checking emails or surfing the internet. Because of these, there is lesser time for families to spend together. This must change We must not let technology affect the time we spend with them.

                            21. How does social media change family relationships?. affirmative statements and negative statements ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Affirmative Statement</strong><p><strong>Communication</strong> is <strong>important</strong> on a family to <strong>strengthen their relationship</strong> with each other. This is one of the features that <strong>social media</strong> allows us to do; to <strong>communicate</strong> through <strong>messages, voice calls, or video calls</strong> no matter where we are and how far are we. In the Philippines, not every single member of some Filipino families is at<strong> home</strong>; either someone work <strong>abroad</strong> or in the <strong>city</strong> for the family's <strong>needs</strong> which we live too <strong>far</strong> for us to even <strong>meet</strong> them in real life. This is where Filipino families take <strong>advantage</strong> of the communication feature in social media. When one of their members is far away from them, they simply <strong>message</strong> or <strong>call</strong> them when all of them have free time. This allows them to still have a <strong>relationship</strong> with each other even when someone is far away.</p><p></p>Negative Statement<p>Although some families are far away to each other making social media an <strong>advantage</strong>, some families are only in one <strong>household</strong>. Meaning they can have a <strong>relationship</strong> or what they call <strong>'bonding'</strong> with each other without any use of social media, especially when all of them have <strong>free time</strong>. But the question is, how do these families <strong>spend</strong> their time together on their <strong>free time</strong>? Do they have a<strong> family bonding</strong> which is good? Or maybe their <strong>busy </strong>on <strong>social media</strong> with their own <strong>devices</strong> in their own <strong>rooms</strong>? Social media is <strong>too convenient</strong> that we <strong>forget</strong> our relationships in our family, friends, and relatives in real life. Social media is always there for you to <strong>access</strong> it, but you and your family together at home is very <strong>rare</strong> so <strong>treasure</strong> every <strong>moment </strong>with them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#BrainliestBunch</p><br />
